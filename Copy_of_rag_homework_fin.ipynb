        "Chunks need to be vectorized and made accessible to an LLM to enable semantic search with embedding models. A current industry standard is to use a vector database to store and retrieve texts both conveniently and efficiently. There are many products out there, we'll be using [LanceDB](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/). LanceDB is a young product, one way it stands out is that it's embedded - it's designed not to be a standalone service but rather a part of an application, more on this [here](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/basic/).\n",

        "A reranker is a second-level model which produces similarity scores for pairs of (input query + retrieved document). Cross-encoders are conventionally used for reranking, their architecture is slightly different from retrieval models (more on it [here] and [here](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html)). Cross-encoders are much more costly to run, therefore a retrieval model is used to get a few (dozens) highest-scoring items, and a reranker picks the best among these. The overall pipeline is similar to the recommender system industry standard: a light model retrieves top-n, a precise and heavy model reranks n to get top k, n is orders of magnitude larger than k.\n",

        "Cross-encoders are optional because of the overhead their usage implies. Your task is to implement a reranker using a cross-encoder and assess pros and cons of having it.
