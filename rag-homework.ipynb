A current industry standard is to use a vector database to store and retrieve texts both conveniently and efficiently. There are many products out there, we'll be using [LanceDB](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/). LanceDB is a young product, one way it stands out is that it's embedded - it's designed not to be a standalone service but rather a part of an application, more on this [here](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/basic/).\n",

Use prep_scrips/lancedb_setup.py to vectorize chunks and store vector representations along with raw text in a Lancedb instance.

    "A reranker is a second-level model which produces similarity scores for pairs of (input query + retrieved document). Cross-encoders are conventionally used for reranking, their architecture is slightly different from retrieval models (more on it [here]). Cross-encoders are much more costly to run, therefore a retrieval model is used to get a few (dozens) highest-scoring items, and a reranker picks the best among these. The overall pipeline is similar to the recommender system indudustry standard: a light model retrieves top-n, a precise and heavy model reranks n to get top k, n is orders of magnitude larger than k.\n",
