This'll give you a chance to experiment and make sure everything works before spending more time training on the full dataset.

from datasets import load_dataset
eli5 = load_dataset("eli5_category", split="train[:5000]")

Split the dataset's train split into a train and test set with the [~datasets.Dataset.train_test_split] method:

eli5 = eli5.train_test_split(test_size=0.2)

Then take a look at an example:

eli5["train"][0]
{'q_id': '7h191n',
 'title': 'What does the tax bill that was passed today mean? How will it affect Americans in each tax bracket?',
 'selftext': '',
 'category': 'Economics',
 'subreddit': 'explainlikeimfive',
 'answers': {'a_id': ['dqnds8l', 'dqnd1jl', 'dqng3i1', 'dqnku5x'],
  'text': ["The tax bill is 500 pages long and there were a lot of changes still going on right to the end.
