For the
first time, we show how to pre-train such a knowledge retriever in an unsupervised manner, using masked language
modeling as the learning signal and backpropagating through a retrieval step that considers millions of documents. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning on the
challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA).
