If this is not the case and each node can only see the local filesystem, you need to adjust the config file to include a checkpoint to allow loading without access to a shared filesystem:
yaml
{
  "checkpoint": {
    "use_node_local_storage": true
  }
}
You could also use the [Trainer]'s --save_on_each_node argument to automatically add the above checkpoint to your config.
