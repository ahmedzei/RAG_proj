The script automatically discovers the subfolder containing the checkpoint.

python zero_to_fp32.py . pytorch_model.bin

Run python zero_to_fp32.py -h for more usage details. The script requires 2x the general RAM of the final fp32 weights.

ZeRO Inference
ZeRO Inference places the model weights in CPU or NVMe memory to avoid burdening the GPU which makes it possible to run inference with huge models on a GPU.
