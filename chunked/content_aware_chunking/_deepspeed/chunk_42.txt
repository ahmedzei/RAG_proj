However, if you use gradient accumulation with bf16, gradients are accumulated in bf16 which may not be desired because this format's low precision can lead to lossy accumulation.
bf16 can be setup in the config file or enabled from the command line when the following arguments are passed: --bf16 or --bf16_full_eval.
yaml
{
    "bf16": {
        "enabled": "auto"
    }
}

Batch size
The batch size can be auto-configured or explicitly set.
