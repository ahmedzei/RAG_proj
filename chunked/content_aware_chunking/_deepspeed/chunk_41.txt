[Trainer] automatically configure amp based on the values of args.fp16_backend and args.fp16_opt_level. It can also be enabled from the command line when the following arguments are passed: --fp16, --fp16_backend apex or --fp16_opt_level 01.
yaml
{
    "amp": {
        "enabled": "auto",
        "opt_level": "auto"
    }
}

To use bf16, you'll need at least DeepSpeed==0.6.0. bf16 has the same dynamic range as fp32 and doesnâ€™t require loss scaling.
