If your GPU memory is 8GB or less, you should reduce overlap_comm to lower the memory requirements and prevent an out-of-memory (OOM) error.
allgather_bucket_size and reduce_bucket_size trade off available GPU memory for communication speed. The smaller their values, the slower communication is and the more GPU memory is available.
