The important nuance to understand here is that the way ZeRO is designed, you can process different inputs on different GPUs in parallel.
Make sure to:

disable CPU offload if you have enough GPU memory (since it slows things down).
enable bf16 if you have an Ampere or newer GPU to make things faster.
