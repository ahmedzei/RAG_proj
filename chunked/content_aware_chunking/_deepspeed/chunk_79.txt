In this case, check whether your configuration file has either offload_optimizer, offload_param or both configured to offload to the CPU. 
If you have NVMe and ZeRO-3 setup, experiment with offloading to the NVMe (estimate the memory requirements for your model).
NaN loss
NaN loss often occurs when a model is pretrained in bf16 and then you try to use it with fp16 (especially relevant for TPU trained models).
