Smart partitioning and tiling algorithms allow each GPU to send and receive very small amounts of data during offloading such that a modern NVMe can fit an even larger total memory pool than is available to your training process. ZeRO-Infinity requires ZeRO-3.
Depending on the CPU and/or NVMe memory available, you can offload both the optimizer states and parameters, just one of them, or none.
