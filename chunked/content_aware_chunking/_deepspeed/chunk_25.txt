In this case, reduce sub_group_size to reduce memory usage of the temporary buffers.
The optimizer step is taking a really long time. In this case, increase sub_group_size to improve bandwidth utilization as a result of increased data buffers.

reduce_bucket_size, stage3_prefetch_bucket_size, and stage3_param_persistence_threshold are dependent on a model's hidden size.
