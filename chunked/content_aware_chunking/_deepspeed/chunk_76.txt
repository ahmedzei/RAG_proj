So for 2 gpus you process 2 inputs at once.
If you use more GPUs adjust for more.
And of course if you have just one input to process you then need to pass the same string to both gpus
If you use only one GPU, then you will have only rank 0.
rank = torch.distributed.get_rank()
if rank == 0:
    text_in = "Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy"
elif rank == 1:
    text_in = "Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the worst restaurant ever"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
inputs = tokenizer.encode(text_in, return_tensors="pt").to(device=local_rank)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = ds_engine.module.generate(inputs, synced_gpus=True)
text_out = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(f"rank{rank}:\n   in={text_in}\n  out={text_out}")

Save the script as t0.py and launch it:

$ deepspeed --num_gpus 2 t0.py
rank0:
   in=Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy
  out=Positive
rank1:
   in=Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the worst restaurant ever
  out=negative
This is a very basic example and you'll want to adapt it to your use case.
Generate
Using multiple GPUs with ZeRO-3 for generation requires synchronizing the GPUs by setting synced_gpus=True in the [~GenerationMixin.generate] method.
