We simplify and speed-up the training by using a single multiscale spectrogram adversary that efficiently reduces artifacts and produce high-quality samples. We introduce a novel loss balancer mechanism to stabilize training: the weight of a loss now defines the fraction of the overall gradient it should represent, thus decoupling the choice of this hyper-parameter from the typical scale of the loss.
