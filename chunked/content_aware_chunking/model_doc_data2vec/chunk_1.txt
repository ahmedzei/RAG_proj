Data2Vec
Overview
The Data2Vec model was proposed in data2vec: A General Framework for Self-supervised Learning in Speech, Vision and Language by Alexei Baevski, Wei-Ning Hsu, Qiantong Xu, Arun Babu, Jiatao Gu and Michael Auli.
Data2Vec proposes a unified framework for self-supervised learning across different data modalities - text, audio and images.
Importantly, predicted targets for pre-training are contextualized latent representations of the inputs, rather than modality-specific, context-independent targets.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
While the general idea of self-supervised learning is identical across modalities, the actual algorithms and
objectives differ widely because they were developed with a single modality in mind.
