For example, base-size BEiT achieves 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
significantly outperforming from-scratch DeiT training (81.8%) with the same setup. Moreover, large-size BEiT obtains
86.3% only using ImageNet-1K, even outperforming ViT-L with supervised pre-training on ImageNet-22K (85.2%).
