You can check out demo notebooks regarding inference as well as
  fine-tuning on custom data here (you can just replace
  [ViTFeatureExtractor] by [BeitImageProcessor] and
  [ViTForImageClassification] by [BeitForImageClassification]).
There's also a demo notebook available which showcases how to combine DALL-E's image tokenizer with BEiT for
  performing masked image modeling.
