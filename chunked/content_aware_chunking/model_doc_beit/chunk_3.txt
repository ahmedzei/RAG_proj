The pre-training
objective is to recover the original visual tokens based on the corrupted image patches. After pre-training BEiT, we
directly fine-tune the model parameters on downstream tasks by appending task layers upon the pretrained encoder.
Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation show that our model achieves competitive results
with previous pre-training methods.
