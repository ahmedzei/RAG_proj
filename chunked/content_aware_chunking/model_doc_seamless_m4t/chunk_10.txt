Change the speaker identity
You have the possibility to change the speaker used for speech synthesis with the spkr_id argument. Some spkr_id works better than other for some languages!
3. Change the generation strategy
You can use different generation strategies for speech and text generation, e.g .generate(input_ids=input_ids, text_num_beams=4, speech_do_sample=True) which will successively perform beam-search decoding on the text model, and multinomial sampling on the speech model.
