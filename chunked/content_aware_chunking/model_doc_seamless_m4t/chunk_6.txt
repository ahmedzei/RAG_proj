Usage
First, load the processor and a checkpoint of the model:
thon

from transformers import AutoProcessor, SeamlessM4TModel
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium")
model = SeamlessM4TModel.from_pretrained("facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium")

You can seamlessly use this model on text or on audio, to generated either translated text or translated audio.
Here is how to use the processor to process text and audio:
thon

let's load an audio sample from an Arabic speech corpus
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("arabic_speech_corpus", split="test", streaming=True)
audio_sample = next(iter(dataset))["audio"]
now, process it
audio_inputs = processor(audios=audio_sample["array"], return_tensors="pt")
now, process some English test as well
text_inputs = processor(text = "Hello, my dog is cute", src_lang="eng", return_tensors="pt")

Speech
[SeamlessM4TModel] can seamlessly generate text or speech with few or no changes.
