Additionally, for speech output, a vocoder inspired by the HiFi-GAN architecture is placed on top of the second seq2seq model.
Here's how the generation process works:

Input text or speech is processed through its specific encoder.
A decoder creates text tokens in the desired language.
If speech generation is required, the second seq2seq model, following a standard encoder-decoder structure, generates unit tokens.
These unit tokens are then passed through the final vocoder to produce the actual speech.
