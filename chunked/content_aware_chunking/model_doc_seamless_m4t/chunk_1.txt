For the updated version 2 release, refer to the Seamless M4T v2 docs.
SeamlessM4T is a collection of models designed to provide high quality translation, allowing people from different linguistic communities to communicate effortlessly through speech and text.
SeamlessM4T enables multiple tasks without relying on separate models:

Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST)
Speech-to-text translation (S2TT)
Text-to-speech translation (T2ST)
Text-to-text translation (T2TT)
Automatic speech recognition (ASR)

[SeamlessM4TModel] can perform all the above tasks, but each task also has its own dedicated sub-model.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
What does it take to create the Babel Fish, a tool that can help individuals translate speech between any two languages? While recent breakthroughs in text-based models have pushed machine translation coverage beyond 200 languages, unified speech-to-speech translation models have yet to achieve similar strides.
