Depth Anything is based on the DPT architecture, trained on ~62 million images, obtaining state-of-the-art results for both relative and absolute depth estimation.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
This work presents Depth Anything, a highly practical solution for robust monocular depth estimation. Without pursuing novel technical modules, we aim to build a simple yet powerful foundation model dealing with any images under any circumstances.
