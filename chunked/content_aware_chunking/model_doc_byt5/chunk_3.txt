In this paper, we show that a standard Transformer architecture can be used with
minimal modifications to process byte sequences. We carefully characterize the trade-offs in terms of parameter count,
training FLOPs, and inference speed, and show that byte-level models are competitive with their token-level
counterparts. We also demonstrate that byte-level models are significantly more robust to noise and perform better on
tasks that are sensitive to spelling and pronunciation.
