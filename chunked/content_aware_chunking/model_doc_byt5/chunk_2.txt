Token-free models that instead operate directly on raw text (bytes or characters) have many benefits: they
can process text in any language out of the box, they are more robust to noise, and they minimize technical debt by
removing complex and error-prone text preprocessing pipelines. Since byte or character sequences are longer than token
sequences, past work on token-free models has often introduced new model architectures designed to amortize the cost of
operating directly on raw text.
