input_ids = tokenizer(input_ids_prompt).input_ids
Note that we cannot add "{extra_id_}" to the string directly
as the Byte tokenizer would incorrectly merge the tokens
For ByT5, we need to work directly on the character level
Contrary to T5, ByT5 does not use sentinel tokens for masking, but instead
uses final utf character ids.
