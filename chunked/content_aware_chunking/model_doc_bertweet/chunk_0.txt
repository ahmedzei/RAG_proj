BERTweet
Overview
The BERTweet model was proposed in BERTweet: A pre-trained language model for English Tweets by Dat Quoc Nguyen, Thanh Vu, Anh Tuan Nguyen.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We present BERTweet, the first public large-scale pre-trained language model for English Tweets. Our BERTweet, having
the same architecture as BERT-base (Devlin et al., 2019), is trained using the RoBERTa pre-training procedure (Liu et
al., 2019).
