max-autotune takes longer than reduce-overhead but results in faster inference. Default mode is fastest for compilation but is not as efficient compared to reduce-overhead for inference time. In this guide, we used the default mode. You can learn more about it here.
We benchmarked torch.compile with different computer vision models, tasks, types of hardware, and batch sizes on torch version 2.0.1.
