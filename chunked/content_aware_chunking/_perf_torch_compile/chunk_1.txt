Compiling a model takes time, so it's useful if you are compiling the model only once instead of every time you infer.
To compile any computer vision model of your choice, call torch.compile() on the model as shown below:

from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID).to("cuda")
+ model = torch.compile(model)

compile()Â comes with multiple modes for compiling, which essentially differ in compilation time and inference overhead.
