Additionally, we release HerBERT, a Transformer-based model trained specifically for the Polish language,
which has the best average performance and obtains the best results for three out of nine tasks. Finally, we provide an
extensive evaluation, including several standard baselines and recently proposed, multilingual Transformer-based
models.
