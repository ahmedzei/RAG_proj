Next, to endow our model with the capability of connecting vision and language
semantics, we pre-train the model with large amounts of image-and-sentence pairs, via five diverse representative
pretraining tasks: masked language modeling, masked object prediction (feature regression and label classification),
cross-modality matching, and image question answering. These tasks help in learning both intra-modality and
cross-modality relationships.
