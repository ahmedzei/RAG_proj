We thus propose the LXMERT (Learning Cross-Modality
Encoder Representations from Transformers) framework to learn these vision-and-language connections. In LXMERT, we
build a large-scale Transformer model that consists of three encoders: an object relationship encoder, a language
encoder, and a cross-modality encoder.
