After fine-tuning from our pretrained parameters, our model achieves the state-of-the-art
results on two visual question answering datasets (i.e., VQA and GQA). We also show the generalizability of our
pretrained cross-modality model by adapting it to a challenging visual-reasoning task, NLVR, and improve the previous
best result by 22% absolute (54% to 76%).
