You can add a model card by:

Manually creating and uploading a README.md file.
Clicking on the Edit model card button in your model repository.

Take a look at the DistilBert model card for a good example of the type of information a model card should include. For more details about other options you can control in the README.md file such as a model's carbon footprint or widget examples, refer to the documentation here..
