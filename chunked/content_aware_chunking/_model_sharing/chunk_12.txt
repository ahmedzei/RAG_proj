Users can now load your model with the from_pretrained function:

from transformers import AutoModel
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("your_username/my-awesome-model")

If you belong to an organization and want to push your model under the organization name instead, just add it to the repo_id:

pt_model.push_to_hub("my-awesome-org/my-awesome-model")

The push_to_hub function can also be used to add other files to a model repository.
