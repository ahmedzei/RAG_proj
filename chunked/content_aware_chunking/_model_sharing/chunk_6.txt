While users are still able to load your model from a different framework if you skip this step, it will be slower because ðŸ¤— Transformers will need to convert the checkpoint on-the-fly.
Converting a checkpoint for another framework is easy. Make sure you have PyTorch and TensorFlow installed (see here for installation instructions), and then find the specific model for your task in the other framework.
