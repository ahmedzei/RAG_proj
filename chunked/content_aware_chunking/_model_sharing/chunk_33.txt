For example, add a tokenizer to a model repository:

tokenizer.push_to_hub("my-awesome-model")

Or perhaps you'd like to add the TensorFlow version of your fine-tuned PyTorch model:

tf_model.push_to_hub("my-awesome-model")

Now when you navigate to your Hugging Face profile, you should see your newly created model repository.
