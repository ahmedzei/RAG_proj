Repository features
Each repository on the Model Hub behaves like a typical GitHub repository. Our repositories offer versioning, commit history, and the ability to visualize differences.
The Model Hub's built-in versioning is based on git and git-lfs. In other words, you can treat one model as one repository, enabling greater access control and scalability.
