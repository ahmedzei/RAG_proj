Version control allows revisions, a method for pinning a specific version of a model with a commit hash, tag or branch.
As a result, you can load a specific model version with the revision parameter:

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
     "julien-c/EsperBERTo-small", revision="v2.0.1"  # tag name, or branch name, or commit hash
 )

Files are also easily edited in a repository, and you can view the commit history as well as the difference:

Setup
Before sharing a model to the Hub, you will need your Hugging Face credentials.
