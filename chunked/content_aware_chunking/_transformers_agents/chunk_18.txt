If you want to be on the super safe side, you can execute the 
run() method with the additional argument return_code=True, in which case the agent will just return the code 
to execute and you can decide whether to do it or not.
The execution will stop at any line trying to perform an illegal operation or if there is a regular Python error 
with the code generated by the agent.
