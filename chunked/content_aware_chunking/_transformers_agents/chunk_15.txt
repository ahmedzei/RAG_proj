Through the prompt, we show the agent how it would leverage tools to perform what was 
requested in the query.
This is using brand-new tools and not pipelines, because the agent writes better code with very atomic tools. 
Pipelines are more refactored and often combine several tasks in one. Tools are meant to be focused on
one very simple task only.
Code-execution?!
This code is then executed with our small Python interpreter on the set of inputs passed along with your tools.
