It
can perform one or several tasks in the same instruction (though the more complex your instruction, the more likely
the agent is to fail).
py
agent.run("Draw me a picture of the sea then transform the picture to add an island")

Every [~Agent.run] operation is independent, so you can run it several times in a row with different tasks.
Note that your agent is just a large-language model, so small variations in your prompt might yield completely
different results.
