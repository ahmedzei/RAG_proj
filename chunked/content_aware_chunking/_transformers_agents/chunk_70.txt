For example, the following instruction
python
agent.run("Draw me a picture of rivers and lakes", return_code=True)
returns the following code
thon
from transformers import load_tool
image_generator = load_tool("huggingface-tools/text-to-image")
image = image_generator(prompt="rivers and lakes")

that you can then modify and execute yourself.
