This prompt is then completed by the 
task you give your agent and the description of the tools you give it. This way it gets access to the doc of the 
tools you are using, especially their expected inputs and outputs, and can generate the relevant code.
Tools
Tools are very simple: they're a single function, with a name, and a description. We then use these tools' descriptions 
to prompt the agent.
