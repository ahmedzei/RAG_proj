The openAI
models perform better (but require you to have an openAI API key, so cannot be used for free); Hugging Face is
providing free access to endpoints for BigCode and OpenAssistant models.
To start with, please install the agents extras in order to install all default dependencies.

pip install transformers[agents]
To use openAI models, you instantiate an [OpenAiAgent] after installing the openai dependency:

pip install openai

from transformers import OpenAiAgent
agent = OpenAiAgent(model="text-davinci-003", api_key="")

To use BigCode or OpenAssistant, start by logging in to have access to the Inference API:

from huggingface_hub import login
login("")

Then, instantiate the agent

from transformers import HfAgent
Starcoder
agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder")
StarcoderBase
agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoderbase")
OpenAssistant
agent = HfAgent(url_endpoint="https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-4-pythia-12b-epoch-3.5")

This is using the inference API that Hugging Face provides for free at the moment.
