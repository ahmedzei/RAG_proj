We've added a few 
transformers-agnostic tools to the huggingface-tools organization:

Text downloader: to download a text from a web URL
Text to image: generate an image according to a prompt, leveraging stable diffusion
Image transformation: modify an image given an initial image and a prompt, leveraging instruct pix2pix stable diffusion
Text to video: generate a small video according to a prompt, leveraging damo-vilab

The text-to-image tool we have been using since the beginning is a remote tool that lives in 
huggingface-tools/text-to-image!
