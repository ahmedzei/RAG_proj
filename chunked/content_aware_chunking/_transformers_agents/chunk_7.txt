If you're facing such an issue, we recommend trying out the OpenAI
model which, while sadly not open-source, performs better at this given time.

You're now good to go! Let's dive into the two APIs that you now have at your disposal.
Single execution (run)
The single execution method is when using the [~Agent.run] method of the agent:
py
agent.run("Draw me a picture of rivers and lakes.")

It automatically selects the tool (or tools) appropriate for the task you want to perform and runs them appropriately.
