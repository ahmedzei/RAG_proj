For instance
python
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-cased")
will create a model that is an instance of [BertModel].
There is one class of AutoModel for each task, and for each backend (PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Flax).
Extending the Auto Classes
Each of the auto classes has a method to be extended with your custom classes.
