Auto Classes
In many cases, the architecture you want to use can be guessed from the name or the path of the pretrained model you
are supplying to the from_pretrained() method. AutoClasses are here to do this job for you so that you
automatically retrieve the relevant model given the name/path to the pretrained weights/config/vocabulary.
Instantiating one of [AutoConfig], [AutoModel], and
[AutoTokenizer] will directly create a class of the relevant architecture.
