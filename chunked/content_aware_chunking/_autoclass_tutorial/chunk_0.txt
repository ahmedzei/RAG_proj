Load pretrained instances with an AutoClass
With so many different Transformer architectures, it can be challenging to create one for your checkpoint. As a part of ðŸ¤— Transformers core philosophy to make the library easy, simple and flexible to use, an AutoClass automatically infers and loads the correct architecture from a given checkpoint. The from_pretrained() method lets you quickly load a pretrained model for any architecture so you don't have to devote time and resources to train a model from scratch.
