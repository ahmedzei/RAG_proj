See the Hub documentation for best practices like signed commit verification with GPG.
TensorFlow and Flax checkpoints are not affected, and can be loaded within PyTorch architectures using the from_tf and from_flax kwargs for the from_pretrained method to circumvent this issue.

Generally, we recommend using the AutoTokenizer class and the AutoModelFor class to load pretrained instances of models. This will ensure you load the correct architecture every time.
