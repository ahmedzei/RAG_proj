Instead, the model is trained directly at a Unicode character-level.
Training at a character-level inevitably comes with a longer sequence length, which CANINE solves with an efficient
downsampling strategy, before applying a deep Transformer encoder.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Pipelined NLP systems have largely been superseded by end-to-end neural modeling, yet nearly all commonly-used models
still require an explicit tokenization step.
