CANINE
Overview
The CANINE model was proposed in CANINE: Pre-training an Efficient Tokenization-Free Encoder for Language
Representation by Jonathan H. Clark, Dan Garrette, Iulia Turc, John Wieting. It's
among the first papers that trains a Transformer without using an explicit tokenization step (such as Byte Pair
Encoding (BPE), WordPiece or SentencePiece).
