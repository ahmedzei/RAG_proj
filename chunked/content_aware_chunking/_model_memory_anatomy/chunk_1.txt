For the demonstration, 
we'll need to install a few libraries: 

pip install transformers datasets accelerate nvidia-ml-py3
The nvidia-ml-py3 library allows us to monitor the memory usage of the models from within Python. You might be familiar 
with the nvidia-smi command in the terminal - this library allows to access the same information in Python directly.
Then, we create some dummy data: random token IDs between 100 and 30000 and binary labels for a classifier.
