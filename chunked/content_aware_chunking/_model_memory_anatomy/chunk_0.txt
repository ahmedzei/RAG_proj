Model training anatomy
To understand performance optimization techniques that one can apply to improve efficiency of model training 
speed and memory utilization, it's helpful to get familiar with how GPU is utilized during training, and how compute 
intensity varies depending on an operation performed.
Let's start by exploring a motivating example of GPU utilization and the training run of a model.
