We show that decoupled embeddings provide increased modeling flexibility, allowing us to
significantly improve the efficiency of parameter allocation in the input embedding of multilingual models. By
reallocating the input embedding parameters in the Transformer layers, we achieve dramatically better performance on
standard natural language understanding tasks with the same number of parameters during fine-tuning.
