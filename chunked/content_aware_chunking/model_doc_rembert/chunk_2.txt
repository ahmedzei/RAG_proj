We also show that
allocating additional capacity to the output embedding provides benefits to the model that persist through the
fine-tuning stage even though the output embedding is discarded after pre-training. Our analysis shows that larger
output embeddings prevent the model's last layers from overspecializing to the pre-training task and encourage
Transformer representations to be more general and more transferable to other tasks and languages.
