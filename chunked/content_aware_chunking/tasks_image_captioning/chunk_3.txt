In those cases, a common strategy is to randomly sample a caption amongst the available ones during training. 

Split the datasetâ€™s train split into a train and test set with the [~datasets.Dataset.train_test_split] method:
python
ds = ds["train"].train_test_split(test_size=0.1)
train_ds = ds["train"]
test_ds = ds["test"]
Let's visualize a couple of samples from the training set.
