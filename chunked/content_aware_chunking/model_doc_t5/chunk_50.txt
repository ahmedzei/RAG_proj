", return_tensors="pt").input_ids
the forward function automatically creates the correct decoder_input_ids
loss = model(input_ids=input_ids, labels=labels).loss
loss.item()
0.2542

As you can see, only 2 inputs are required for the model in order to compute a loss: input_ids (which are the
input_ids of the encoded input sequence) and labels (which are the input_ids of the encoded
target sequence).
