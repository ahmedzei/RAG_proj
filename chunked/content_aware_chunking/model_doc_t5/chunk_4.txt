Supervised training is conducted on downstream tasks provided by the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks (converting them into text-to-text tasks as explained above).

Self-supervised training uses corrupted tokens, by randomly removing 15% of the tokens and replacing them with individual sentinel tokens (if several consecutive tokens are marked for removal, the whole group is replaced with a single sentinel token).
