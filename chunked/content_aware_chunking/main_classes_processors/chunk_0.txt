Processors
Processors can mean two different things in the Transformers library:
- the objects that pre-process inputs for multi-modal models such as Wav2Vec2 (speech and text)
  or CLIP (text and vision)
- deprecated objects that were used in older versions of the library to preprocess data for GLUE or SQUAD.
Multi-modal processors
Any multi-modal model will require an object to encode or decode the data that groups several modalities (among text,
vision and audio).
