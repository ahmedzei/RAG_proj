[~data.processors.utils.SquadV1Processor]
[~data.processors.utils.SquadV2Processor]

    - all
Additionally, the following method can be used to convert SQuAD examples into
[~data.processors.utils.SquadFeatures] that can be used as model inputs.
[[autodoc]] data.processors.squad.squad_convert_examples_to_features
These processors as well as the aforementioned method can be used with files containing the data as well as with the
tensorflow_datasets package.
