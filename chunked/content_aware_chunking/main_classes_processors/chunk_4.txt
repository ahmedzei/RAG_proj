XNLI is crowd-sourced dataset based on MultiNLI: pairs of text are labeled with textual entailment annotations for 15
different languages (including both high-resource language such as English and low-resource languages such as Swahili).
It was released together with the paper XNLI: Evaluating Cross-lingual Sentence Representations
This library hosts the processor to load the XNLI data:

[~data.processors.utils.XnliProcessor]

Please note that since the gold labels are available on the test set, evaluation is performed on the test set.
An example using these processors is given in the run_xnli.py script.
