The retriever and seq2seq modules are initialized from pretrained models, and fine-tuned jointly, allowing
both retrieval and generation to adapt to downstream tasks.
It is based on the paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks by Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandara Piktus, Fabio Petroni, Vladimir
Karpukhin, Naman Goyal, Heinrich Küttler, Mike Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Tim Rocktäschel, Sebastian Riedel, Douwe Kiela.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve
state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks.
