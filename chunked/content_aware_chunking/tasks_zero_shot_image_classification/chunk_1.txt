When there's a need to use such model for a classification task that introduces a
new set of labels, fine-tuning is required to "recalibrate" the model.
In contrast, zero-shot or open vocabulary image classification models are typically multi-modal models that have been trained on a large
dataset of images and associated descriptions.
