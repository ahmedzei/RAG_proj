ALIGN features a dual-encoder architecture with EfficientNet as its vision encoder and BERT as its text encoder, and learns to align visual and text representations with contrastive learning. Unlike previous work, ALIGN leverages a massive noisy dataset and shows that the scale of the corpus can be used to achieve SOTA representations with a simple recipe.

Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception tasks.
