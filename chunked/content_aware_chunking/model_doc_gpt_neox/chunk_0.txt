GPT-NeoX
Overview
We introduce GPT-NeoX-20B, a 20 billion parameter autoregressive language model trained on the Pile, whose weights will
be made freely and openly available to the public through a permissive license. It is, to the best of our knowledge,
the largest dense autoregressive model that has publicly available weights at the time of submission.
