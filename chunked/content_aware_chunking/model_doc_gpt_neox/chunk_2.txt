We open-source
the training and evaluation code, as well as the model weights, at https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox.
Development of the model was led by Sid Black, Stella Biderman and Eric Hallahan, and the model was trained with
generous the support of CoreWeave.
GPT-NeoX-20B was trained with fp16, thus it is recommended to initialize the model as follows:
python
model = GPTNeoXForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b").half().cuda()
GPT-NeoX-20B also has a different tokenizer from the one used in GPT-J-6B and GPT-Neo.
