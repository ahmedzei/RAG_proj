Therefore, with some exceptions for essential tests, slow tests should be
marked as in the example below:
python no-style
from transformers.testing_utils import slow
@slow
def test_integration_foo():
Once a test is marked as @slow, to run such tests set RUN_SLOW=1 env var, e.g.:

RUN_SLOW=1 pytest tests
Some decorators like @parameterized rewrite test names, therefore @slow and the rest of the skip decorators
@require_* have to be listed last for them to work correctly.
