For example:
thon
from transformers.testing_utils import TestCasePlus
class PathExampleTest(TestCasePlus):
    def test_something_involving_stringified_locations(self):
        examples_dir = self.examples_dir_str

Temporary files and directories
Using unique temporary files and directories are essential for parallel test running, so that the tests won't overwrite
each other's data. Also we want to get the temporary files and directories removed at the end of each test that created
them.
