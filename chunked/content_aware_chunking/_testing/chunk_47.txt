A common example is a test for a feature not yet
  implemented, or a bug not yet fixed. When a test passes despite being expected to fail (marked with
  pytest.mark.xfail), itâ€™s an xpass and will be reported in the test summary.

One of the important differences between the two is that skip doesn't run the test, and xfail does.
