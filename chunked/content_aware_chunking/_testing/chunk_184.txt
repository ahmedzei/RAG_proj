the last command must be a success: echo "done" or just true will do

Here is an example:
yaml
- run:
    name: run CI experiment
    command: |
        set +euo pipefail
        echo "setting run-all-despite-any-errors-mode"
        this_command_will_fail
        echo "but bash continues to run"
        # emulate another failure
        false
        # but the last command must be a success
        echo "during experiment do not remove: reporting success to CI, even if there were failures"
For simple commands you could also do:

cmd_that_may_fail || true
Of course, once satisfied with the results, integrate the experimental step or job with the rest of the normal jobs,
while removing set +euo pipefail or any other things you may have added to ensure that the experimental job doesn't
interfere with the normal CI functioning.
