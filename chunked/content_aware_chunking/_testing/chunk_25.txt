For example, to test on CPU only:

TRANSFORMERS_TEST_DEVICE="cpu" pytest tests/utils/test_logging.py
This variable is useful for testing custom or less common PyTorch backends such as mps. It can also be used to achieve the same effect as CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES by targeting specific GPUs or testing in CPU-only mode.
Certain devices will require an additional import after importing torch for the first time.
