Here is what they look like:

pytest test_this2.py --collect-only -q
and it will list:

test_this2.py::test_floor[integer-1-1.0]
test_this2.py::test_floor[negative--1.5--2.0]
test_this2.py::test_floor[large fraction-1.6-1]
So now you can run just the specific test:

pytest test_this2.py::test_floor[negative--1.5--2.0] test_this2.py::test_floor[integer-1-1.0]
as in the previous example.
Files and directories
In tests often we need to know where things are relative to the current test file, and it's not trivial since the test
could be invoked from more than one directory or could reside in sub-directories with different depths.
