The following skip
decorators are used to set the requirements of tests CPU/GPU/TPU-wise:

require_torch - this test will run only under torch
require_torch_gpu - as require_torch plus requires at least 1 GPU
require_torch_multi_gpu - as require_torch plus requires at least 2 GPUs
require_torch_non_multi_gpu - as require_torch plus requires 0 or 1 GPUs
require_torch_up_to_2_gpus - as require_torch plus requires 0 or 1 or 2 GPUs
require_torch_tpu - as require_torch plus requires at least 1 TPU

Let's depict the GPU requirements in the following table:
| n gpus | decorator                      |
|--------+--------------------------------|
| >= 0 | @require_torch               |
| >= 1 | @require_torch_gpu           |
| >= 2 | @require_torch_multi_gpu     |
| < 2  | @require_torch_non_multi_gpu |
| < 3  | @require_torch_up_to_2_gpus  |
For example, here is a test that must be run only when there are 2 or more GPUs available and pytorch is installed:
python no-style
@require_torch_multi_gpu
def test_example_with_multi_gpu():
If a test requires tensorflow use the require_tf decorator.
