Auto-modeling tests, which save and load large files to disk, are a good example of tests that are marked
  as @slow.
If a test completes under 1 second on CI (including downloads if any) then it should be a normal test regardless.

Collectively, all the non-slow tests need to cover entirely the different internals, while remaining fast. For example,
a significant coverage can be achieved by testing with specially created tiny models with random weights.
