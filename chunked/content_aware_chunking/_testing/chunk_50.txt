Here is an example of the correct usage:
python no-style
@parameterized.expand()
@slow
def test_integration_foo():
As explained at the beginning of this document, slow tests get to run on a scheduled basis, rather than in PRs CI
checks. So it's possible that some problems will be missed during a PR submission and get merged. Such problems will
get caught during the next scheduled CI job.
