In order to be able to
commit it to the main repository we need make sure it's skipped during make test.
Methods:

A skip means that you expect your test to pass only if some conditions are met, otherwise pytest should skip
  running the test altogether. Common examples are skipping windows-only tests on non-windows platforms, or skipping
  tests that depend on an external resource which is not available at the moment (for example a database).

A xfail means that you expect a test to fail for some reason.
