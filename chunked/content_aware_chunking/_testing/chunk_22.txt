For example:
python no-style
@require_tf
def test_tf_thing_with_tensorflow():
These decorators can be stacked. For example, if a test is slow and requires at least one GPU under pytorch, here is
how to set it up:
python no-style
@require_torch_gpu
@slow
def test_example_slow_on_gpu():
Some decorators like @parametrized rewrite test names, therefore @require_* skip decorators have to be listed
last for them to work correctly.
