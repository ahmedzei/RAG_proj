Hence check the
execution speed report in CI logs instead (the output of pytest --durations=0 tests).
That report is also useful to find slow outliers that aren't marked as such, or which need to be re-written to be fast.
If you notice that the test suite starts getting slow on CI, the top listing of this report will show the slowest
tests.
Testing the stdout/stderr output
In order to test functions that write to stdout and/or stderr, the test can access those streams using the
pytest's capsys system.
