For example:

pytest tests/test_optimization.py::OptimizationTest
will run all the tests inside that class.
As mentioned earlier you can see what tests are contained inside the OptimizationTest class by running:

pytest tests/test_optimization.py::OptimizationTest --collect-only -q
You can run tests by keyword expressions.
To run only tests whose name contains adam:

pytest -k adam tests/test_optimization.py
Logical and and or can be used to indicate whether all keywords should match or either.
