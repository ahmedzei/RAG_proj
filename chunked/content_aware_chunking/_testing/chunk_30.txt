Here are some tests that use it:

test_trainer_distributed.py
test_deepspeed.py

To jump right into the execution point, search for the execute_subprocess_async call in those tests.
You will need at least 2 GPUs to see these tests in action:

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 RUN_SLOW=1 pytest -sv tests/test_trainer_distributed.py
Output capture
During test execution any output sent to stdout and stderr is captured.
