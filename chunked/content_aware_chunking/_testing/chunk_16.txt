Once you start to
manually narrowing down the list you can no longer rely on the seed, but have to list them manually in the exact order
they failed and tell pytest to not randomize them instead using --random-order-bucket=none, e.g.:

pytest --random-order-bucket=none tests/test_a.py tests/test_c.py tests/test_b.py
To disable the shuffling for all tests:

pytest --random-order-bucket=none
By default --random-order-bucket=module is implied, which will shuffle the files on the module levels.
