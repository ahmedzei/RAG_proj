It will be automatically removed at the end of the
test.

Create a temporary dir of my choice, ensure it's empty before the test starts and don't empty it after the test.

python
def test_whatever(self):
    tmp_dir = self.get_auto_remove_tmp_dir("./xxx")
This is useful for debug when you want to monitor a specific directory and want to make sure the previous tests didn't
leave any data in there.

You can override the default behavior by directly overriding the before and after args, leading to one of the
  following behaviors:

before=True: the temporary dir will always be cleared at the beginning of the test.

before=False: if the temporary dir already existed, any existing files will remain there.
after=True: the temporary dir will always be deleted at the end of the test.
after=False: the temporary dir will always be left intact at the end of the test.

In order to run the equivalent of rm -r safely, only subdirs of the project repository checkout are allowed if
an explicit tmp_dir is used, so that by mistake no /tmp or similar important part of the filesystem will
get nuked.
