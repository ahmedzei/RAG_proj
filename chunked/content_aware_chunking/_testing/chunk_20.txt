For example, to use only the
second gpu if you have gpus 0 and 1, you can run:

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1" pytest tests/utils/test_logging.py
This is handy when you want to run different tasks on different GPUs.
Some tests must be run on CPU-only, others on either CPU or GPU or TPU, yet others on multiple-GPUs.
