If it's focused on an other aspect of the library,
such as the documentation or the examples, then we should run these tests in the slow test suite. And then, to refine
this approach we should have exceptions:

All tests that need to download a heavy set of weights or a dataset that is larger than ~50MB (e.g., model or
  tokenizer integration tests, pipeline integration tests) should be set to slow.
