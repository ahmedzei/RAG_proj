A helper class transformers.test_utils.TestCasePlus comes to help:
thon
from transformers.testing_utils import TestCasePlus
class EnvExampleTest(TestCasePlus):
    def test_external_prog(self):
        env = self.get_env()
        # now call the external program, passing env to it

Depending on whether the test file was under the tests test suite or examples it'll correctly set up
env[PYTHONPATH] to include one of these two directories, and also the src directory to ensure the testing is
done against the current repo, and finally with whatever env[PYTHONPATH] was already set to before the test was
called if anything.
