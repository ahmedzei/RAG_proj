If after reading everything, you need even more details
you will find them here.
Here are some most useful ways of running tests.
Run all:
console
pytest
or:

make test
Note that the latter is defined as:

python -m pytest -n auto --dist=loadfile -s -v ./tests/
which tells pytest to:

run as many test processes as they are CPU cores (which could be too many if you don't have a ton of RAM!)
ensure that all tests from the same file will be run by the same test process
do not capture output
run in verbose mode

Getting the list of all tests
All tests of the test suite:

pytest --collect-only -q
All tests of a given test file:

pytest tests/test_optimization.py --collect-only -q
Run a specific test module
To run an individual test module:

pytest tests/utils/test_logging.py
Run specific tests
Since unittest is used inside most of the tests, to run specific subtests you need to know the name of the unittest
class containing those tests.
