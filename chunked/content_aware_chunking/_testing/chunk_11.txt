This is repeated until all tests pass after
which again a full run is performed.

pip install pytest-xdist
To enter the mode: pytest -f or pytest --looponfail
File changes are detected by looking at looponfailroots root directories and all of their contents (recursively).
If the default for this value does not work for you, you can change it in your project by setting a configuration
option in setup.cfg:
ini
[tool:pytest]
looponfailroots = transformers tests
or pytest.ini/tox.ini files:
ini
[pytest]
looponfailroots = transformers tests
This would lead to only looking for file changes in the respective directories, specified relatively to the ini-fileâ€™s
directory.
pytest-watch is an alternative implementation of this functionality.
Skip a test module
If you want to run all test modules, except a few you can exclude them by giving an explicit list of tests to run.
