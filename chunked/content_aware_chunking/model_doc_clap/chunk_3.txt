We incorporate the feature fusion mechanism and keyword-to-caption augmentation into the model design to further enable the model to process audio inputs of variable lengths and enhance the performance. Third, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate our model across three tasks: text-to-audio retrieval, zero-shot audio classification, and supervised audio classification. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance in text-to-audio retrieval task.
