CLAP
Overview
The CLAP model was proposed in Large Scale Contrastive Language-Audio pretraining with
feature fusion and keyword-to-caption augmentation by Yusong Wu, Ke Chen, Tianyu Zhang, Yuchen Hui, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Shlomo Dubnov.
CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) is a neural network trained on a variety of (audio, text) pairs. It can be instructed in to predict the most relevant text snippet, given an audio, without directly optimizing for the task.
