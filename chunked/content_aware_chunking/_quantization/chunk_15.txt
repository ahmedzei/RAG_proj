If num_key_value_heads=num_attention_heads, the model will use Multi Head Attention (MHA), if num_key_value_heads=1 the model will use Multi Query Attention (MQA), otherwise GQA is used.
"hidden_size": The dimension of the hidden representations.

AutoGPTQ

Try GPTQ quantization with PEFT in this notebook and learn more about it's details in this blog post!

The AutoGPTQ library implements the GPTQ algorithm, a post-training quantization technique where each row of the weight matrix is quantized independently to find a version of the weights that minimizes the error.
