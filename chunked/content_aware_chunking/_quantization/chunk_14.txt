If you don't want to fuse these layers, pass an empty list.
"mlp": The names of the MLP layers you want to fuse into a single MLP layer in the order: (gate (dense, layer, post-attention) / up / down layers).
"use_alibi": If your model uses ALiBi positional embedding.
"num_attention_heads": The number of attention heads.
"num_key_value_heads": The number of key value heads that should be used to implement Grouped Query Attention (GQA).
