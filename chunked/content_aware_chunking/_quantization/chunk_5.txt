The most popular setups, as well as inference kernels they support are:
| Kernel | Number of codebooks | Codebook size, bits | Notation | Accuracy | Speedup     | Fast GPU inference | Fast CPU inference |
|---|---------------------|---------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Triton | K                   | N                  | KxN     | -        | Up to ~0.7x | ✅                  | ❌                  |
| CUDA | 1                   | 16                  | 1x16     | Best        | Up to ~1.3x | ✅                  | ❌                  |

AWQ

Try AWQ quantization with this notebook!

Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) doesn't quantize all the weights in a model, and instead, it preserves a small percentage of weights that are important for LLM performance.
