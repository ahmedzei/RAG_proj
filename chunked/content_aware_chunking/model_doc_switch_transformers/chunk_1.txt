While switch transformers have a lot more weights than their equivalent dense models, the sparsity allows better scaling and better finetuning performance at scale.
During a forward pass, only a fraction of the weights are used. The routing mechanism allows the model to select relevant weights on the fly which increases the model capacity without increasing the number of operations.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs.
