VisionTextDualEncoder
Overview
The [VisionTextDualEncoderModel] can be used to initialize a vision-text dual encoder model with
any pretrained vision autoencoding model as the vision encoder (e.g. ViT, BEiT, DeiT) and any pretrained text autoencoding model as the text encoder (e.g. RoBERTa, BERT). Two projection layers are added on top of both the vision and text encoder to project the output embeddings
to a shared latent space.
