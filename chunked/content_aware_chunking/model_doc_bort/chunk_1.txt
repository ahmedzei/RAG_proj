It is an optimal subset of architectural parameters for the BERT, which the
authors refer to as "Bort".
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We extract an optimal subset of architectural parameters for the BERT architecture from Devlin et al. (2018) by
applying recent breakthroughs in algorithms for neural architecture search.
