Bort is also able to be pretrained in 288 GPU hours, which
is 1.2% of the time required to pretrain the highest-performing BERT parametric architectural variant, RoBERTa-large
(Liu et al., 2019), and about 33% of that of the world-record, in GPU hours, required to train BERT-large on the same
hardware.
