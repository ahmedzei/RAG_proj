ELECTRA

Overview
The ELECTRA model was proposed in the paper ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than
Generators. ELECTRA is a new pretraining approach which trains two
transformer models: the generator and the discriminator. The generator's role is to replace tokens in a sequence, and
is therefore trained as a masked language model.
