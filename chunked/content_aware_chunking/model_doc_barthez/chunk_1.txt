While there are some notable exceptions, most of the available models and research have been
conducted for the English language. In this work, we introduce BARThez, the first BART model for the French language
(to the best of our knowledge). BARThez was pretrained on a very large monolingual French corpus from past research
that we adapted to suit BART's perturbation schemes.
