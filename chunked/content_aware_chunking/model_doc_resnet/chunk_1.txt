ResNet won the 2015 ILSVRC & COCO competition, one important milestone in deep computer vision.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions.
