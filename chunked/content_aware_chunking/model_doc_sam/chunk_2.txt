We are releasing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and corresponding dataset (SA-1B) of 1B masks and 11M images at https://segment-anything.com to foster research into foundation models for computer vision.
Tips:

The model predicts binary masks that states the presence or not of the object of interest given an image.
The model predicts much better results if input 2D points and/or input bounding boxes are provided
You can prompt multiple points for the same image, and predict a single mask.
