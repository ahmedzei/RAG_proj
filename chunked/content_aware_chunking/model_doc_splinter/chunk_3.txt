Given a passage with multiple sets of recurring spans, we mask in each set all
recurring spans but one, and ask the model to select the correct span in the passage for each masked span. Masked spans
are replaced with a special token, viewed as a question representation, that is later used during fine-tuning to select
the answer span.
