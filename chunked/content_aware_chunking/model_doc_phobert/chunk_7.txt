input_ids = torch.tensor([tokenizer.encode(line)])
with torch.no_grad():
     features = phobert(input_ids)  # Models outputs are now tuples
With TensorFlow 2.0+:
from transformers import TFAutoModel
phobert = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained("vinai/phobert-base")

 
PhoBERT implementation is the same as BERT, except for tokenization.
