It's the first paper that successfully trains a Transformer encoder on ImageNet, attaining
very good results compared to familiar convolutional architectures.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its
applications to computer vision remain limited.
