All checkpoints can be found on the hub.
The available checkpoints are either (1) pre-trained on ImageNet-21k (a collection of
  14 million images and 21k classes) only, or (2) also fine-tuned on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC 2012, a collection of 1.3 million
  images and 1,000 classes).
The Vision Transformer was pre-trained using a resolution of 224x224. During fine-tuning, it is often beneficial to
  use a higher resolution than pre-training (Touvron et al., 2019), (Kolesnikov
  et al., 2020).
