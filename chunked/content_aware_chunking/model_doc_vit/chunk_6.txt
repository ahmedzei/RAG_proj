BEiT models outperform supervised pre-trained
  vision transformers using a self-supervised method inspired by BERT (masked image modeling) and based on a VQ-VAE.

DINO (a method for self-supervised training of Vision Transformers) by Facebook AI. Vision Transformers trained using
  the DINO method show very interesting properties not seen with convolutional models. They are capable of segmenting
  objects, without having ever been trained to do so.
