We also propose a Hybrid channel modeling approach to effectively handle noisy channel interactions and generalization across diverse datasets, a common challenge in existing patch channel-mixing methods. Additionally, a simple gated attention mechanism is introduced in the backbone to prioritize important features. By incorporating these lightweight components, we significantly enhance the learning capability of simple MLP structures, outperforming complex Transformer models with minimal computing usage.
