Usage tips

When fine-tuning the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) on your own dataset, it's recommended to take care of the input normalization (to make
sure the input has mean of 0 and std of 0.5). [ASTFeatureExtractor] takes care of this. Note that it uses the AudioSet
mean and std by default.
