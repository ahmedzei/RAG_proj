You can check ast/src/get_norm_stats.py to see how
the authors compute the stats for a downstream dataset.
Note that the AST needs a low learning rate (the authors use a 10 times smaller learning rate compared to their CNN model proposed in the
PSLA paper) and converges quickly, so please search for a suitable learning rate and learning rate scheduler for your task.

A list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by ðŸŒŽ) resources to help you get started with the Audio Spectrogram Transformer.

A notebook illustrating inference with AST for audio classification can be found here.
[ASTForAudioClassification] is supported by this example script and notebook.
