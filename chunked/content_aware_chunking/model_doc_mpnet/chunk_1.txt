MPNet
Overview
The MPNet model was proposed in MPNet: Masked and Permuted Pre-training for Language Understanding by Kaitao Song, Xu Tan, Tao Qin, Jianfeng Lu, Tie-Yan Liu.
MPNet adopts a novel pre-training method, named masked and permuted language modeling, to inherit the advantages of
masked language modeling and permuted language modeling for natural language understanding.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
BERT adopts masked language modeling (MLM) for pre-training and is one of the most successful pre-training models.
Since BERT neglects dependency among predicted tokens, XLNet introduces permuted language modeling (PLM) for
pre-training to address this problem.
