Experimental results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large
margin, and achieves better results on these tasks compared with previous state-of-the-art pre-trained methods (e.g.,
BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa) under the same model setting.

Usage tips
MPNet doesn't have token_type_ids, you don't need to indicate which token belongs to which segment.
