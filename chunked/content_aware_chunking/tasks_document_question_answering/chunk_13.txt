It will then iterate over the words_list and check
if the current word in the words_list (words_list[i]) is equal to the first word of answer_list (answer_list[0]) and if
the sublist of words_list starting from the current word and of the same length as answer_list is equal to answer_list.
If this condition is true, it means that a match has been found, and the function will record the match, its starting index (idx),
and its ending index (idx + len(answer_list) - 1).
