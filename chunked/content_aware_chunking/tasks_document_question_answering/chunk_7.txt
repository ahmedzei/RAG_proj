These are a result of OCR for fine-tuning a different
model. They would still require some processing if we wanted to use them, as they do not match the input requirements
of the model we use in this guide. Instead, we can use the [LayoutLMv2Processor] on the original data for both OCR and
tokenization. This way we'll get the inputs that match model's expected input.
