Let's start by loading the [LayoutLMv2Processor], which internally combines an image processor that can handle image data and a tokenizer that can encode text data.

from transformers import AutoProcessor
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint)

Preprocessing document images
First, let's prepare the document images for the model with the help of the image_processor from the processor.
By default, image processor resizes the images to 224x224, makes sure they have the correct order of color channels,
applies OCR with tesseract to get words and normalized bounding boxes.
