The simplest
way to try out your fine-tuned model for inference is to use it in a [Pipeline].

from transformers import pipeline
pipe = pipeline("visual-question-answering", model="MariaK/vilt_finetuned_200")

The model in this guide has only been trained on 200 examples, so don't expect a lot from it.
