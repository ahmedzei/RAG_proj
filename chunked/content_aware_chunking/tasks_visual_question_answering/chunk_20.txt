Let's see if it at least 
learned something from the data and take the first example from the dataset to illustrate inference:

example = dataset[0]
image = Image.open(example['image_id'])
question = example['question']
print(question)
pipe(image, question, top_k=1)
"Where is he looking?"
[{'score': 0.5498199462890625, 'answer': 'down'}]

Even though not very confident, the model indeed has learned something.
