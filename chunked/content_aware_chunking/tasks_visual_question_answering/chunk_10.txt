Moreover, rather than just creating a one-hot encoded vector, one creates a 
soft encoding, based on the number of times a certain answer appeared in the annotations.
For instance, in the example above, because the answer "down" is selected way more often than other answers, it has a 
score (called weight in the dataset) of 1.0, and the rest of the answers have scores < 1.0.
