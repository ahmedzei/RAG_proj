Take a look at the image and consider which answer would you give:
thon

from PIL import Image
image = Image.open(dataset[0]['image_id'])
image

Due to the questions' and answers' ambiguity, datasets like this are treated as a multi-label classification problem (as 
multiple answers are possibly valid).
