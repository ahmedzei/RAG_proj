The
results show that UniSpeech outperforms self-supervised pretraining and supervised transfer learning for speech
recognition by a maximum of 13.4% and 17.8% relative phone error rate reductions respectively (averaged over all
testing languages). The transferability of UniSpeech is also demonstrated on a domain-shift speech recognition task,
i.e., a relative word error rate reduction of 6% against the previous approach.
