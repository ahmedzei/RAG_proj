The remainder of this guide illustrates how to:

Fine-tune SpeechT5 that was originally trained on English speech on the Dutch (nl) language subset of the VoxPopuli dataset.
Use your refined model for inference in one of two ways: using a pipeline or directly.

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:

pip install datasets soundfile speechbrain accelerate
Install ðŸ¤—Transformers from source as not all the SpeechT5 features have been merged into an official release yet:

pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git

To follow this guide you will need a GPU.
