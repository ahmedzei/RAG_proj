With a total of 20,968 examples in the dataset, this information will give us a better understanding of the distribution of 
speakers and examples in the data.

from collections import defaultdict
speaker_counts = defaultdict(int)
for speaker_id in dataset["speaker_id"]:
     speaker_counts[speaker_id] += 1

By plotting a histogram you can get a sense of how much data there is for each speaker.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure()
plt.hist(speaker_counts.values(), bins=20)
plt.ylabel("Speakers")
plt.xlabel("Examples")
plt.show()

The histogram reveals that approximately one-third of the speakers in the dataset have fewer than 100 examples, while 
around ten speakers have more than 500 examples.
