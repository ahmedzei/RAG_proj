Some models, like Bark, 
can also be conditioned to generate non-verbal communications such as laughing, sighing and crying, or even add music.
Here's an example of how you would use the "text-to-speech" pipeline with Bark: 

from transformers import pipeline
pipe = pipeline("text-to-speech", model="suno/bark-small")
text = "[clears throat] This is a test  and I just took a long pause."
output = pipe(text)

Here's a code snippet you can use to listen to the resulting audio in a notebook: 
thon

from IPython.display import Audio
Audio(output["audio"], rate=output["sampling_rate"])

Audio course.
