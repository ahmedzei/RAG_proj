You'll need the tokenizer part of the processor to process the text:

tokenizer = processor.tokenizer

The dataset examples contain raw_text and normalized_text features. When deciding which feature to use as the text input, 
consider that the SpeechT5 tokenizer doesn't have any tokens for numbers. In normalized_text the numbers are written 
out as text.
