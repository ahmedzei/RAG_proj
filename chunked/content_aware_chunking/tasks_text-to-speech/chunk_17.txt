def select_speaker(speaker_id):
     return 100 <= speaker_counts[speaker_id] <= 400
dataset = dataset.filter(select_speaker, input_columns=["speaker_id"])

Let's check how many speakers remain: 

len(set(dataset["speaker_id"]))
42

Let's see how many examples are left: 

len(dataset)
9973

You are left with just under 10,000 examples from approximately 40 unique speakers, which should be sufficient.
Note that some speakers with few examples may actually have more audio available if the examples are long.
