However, finding top-quality, multilingual, and multi-speaker TTS datasets can be quite 
challenging.
Let's load the data:

from datasets import load_dataset, Audio
dataset = load_dataset("facebook/voxpopuli", "nl", split="train")
len(dataset)
20968

20968 examples should be sufficient for fine-tuning.
