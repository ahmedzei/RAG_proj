Let's create a "text-to-speech" pipeline with your 
checkpoint: 

from transformers import pipeline
pipe = pipeline("text-to-speech", model="YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME/speecht5_finetuned_voxpopuli_nl")

Pick a piece of text in Dutch you'd like narrated, e.g.:

text = "hallo allemaal, ik praat nederlands. groetjes aan iedereen!"

To use SpeechT5 with the pipeline, you'll need a speaker embedding.
