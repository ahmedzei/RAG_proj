While we believe that this model will still generate 
reasonable speaker embeddings for our Dutch dataset, this assumption may not hold true in all cases.
For optimal results, we recommend training an X-vector model on the target speech first. This will ensure that the model 
is better able to capture the unique voice characteristics present in the Dutch language.
Processing the dataset
Finally, let's process the data into the format the model expects.
