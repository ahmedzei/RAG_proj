Text to speech
[[open-in-colab]]
Text-to-speech (TTS) is the task of creating natural-sounding speech from text, where the speech can be generated in multiple 
languages and for multiple speakers. Several text-to-speech models are currently available in ðŸ¤— Transformers, such as 
Bark, MMS, VITS and SpeechT5. 
You can easily generate audio using the "text-to-audio" pipeline (or its alias - "text-to-speech").
