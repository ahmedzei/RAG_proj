The decoder generates a token sequence given a prompt. The prompt is represented by a special token for each downstream task. For example, document parsing has a special parsing token that is combined with the encoder hidden states to parse the document into a structured output format (JSON).

The Decision and Trajectory Transformer casts the state, action, and reward as a sequence modeling problem.
