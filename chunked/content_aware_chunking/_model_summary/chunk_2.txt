This provides a useful taxonomy to categorize and examine the high-level differences within models in the Transformer family, and it'll help you understand Transformers you haven't encountered before.
If you aren't familiar with the original Transformer model or need a refresher, check out the How do Transformers work chapter from the Hugging Face course.

Computer vision

Convolutional network
For a long time, convolutional networks (CNNs) were the dominant paradigm for computer vision tasks until the Vision Transformer demonstrated its scalability and efficiency.
