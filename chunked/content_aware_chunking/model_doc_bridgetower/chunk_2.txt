The abstract from the paper is the following:
Vision-Language (VL) models with the TWO-TOWER architecture have dominated visual-language representation learning in recent years.
Current VL models either use lightweight uni-modal encoders and learn to extract, align and fuse both modalities simultaneously in a deep cross-modal encoder, or feed the last-layer uni-modal representations from the deep pre-trained uni-modal encoders into the top cross-modal encoder.
Both approaches potentially restrict vision-language representation learning and limit model performance.
