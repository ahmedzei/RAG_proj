Pre-trained with only 4M images, BRIDGETOWER achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream vision-language tasks.
In particular, on the VQAv2 test-std set, BRIDGETOWER achieves an accuracy of 78.73%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model METER by 1.09% with the same pre-training data and almost negligible additional parameters and computational costs.
Notably, when further scaling the model, BRIDGETOWER achieves an accuracy of 81.15%, surpassing models that are pre-trained on orders-of-magnitude larger datasets.
