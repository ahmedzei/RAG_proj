The sequence classification head is a linear layer on top of the pooled outputs.

from transformers import TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification
tf_model = TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")

Easily reuse this checkpoint for another task by switching to a different model head. For a question answering task, you would use the [TFDistilBertForQuestionAnswering] model head.
