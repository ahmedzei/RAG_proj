This means models are compatible with each of their respective framework's usage.

Load your custom configuration attributes into the model:

from transformers import DistilBertModel
my_config = DistilBertConfig.from_pretrained("./your_model_save_path/config.json")
model = DistilBertModel(my_config)

This creates a model with random values instead of pretrained weights. You won't be able to use this model for anything useful yet until you train it. Training is a costly and time-consuming process.
