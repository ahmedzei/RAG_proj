However, you can still replace - some or all of - the default model configuration attributes with your own if you'd like:

tf_model = TFDistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased", config=my_config)

Model heads
At this point, you have a base DistilBERT model which outputs the hidden states. The hidden states are passed as inputs to a model head to produce the final output.
