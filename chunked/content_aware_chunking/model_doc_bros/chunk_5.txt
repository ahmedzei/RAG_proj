It predicts relation from one token (of one entity) to another token (of another entity) if these two entities share some relation.
BROS achieves comparable or better result on Key Information Extraction (KIE) benchmarks such as FUNSD, SROIE, CORD and SciTSR, without relying on explicit visual features.
