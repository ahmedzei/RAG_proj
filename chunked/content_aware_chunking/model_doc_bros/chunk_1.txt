BROS encode relative spatial information instead of using absolute spatial information.
It is pre-trained with two objectives: a token-masked language modeling objective (TMLM) used in BERT, and a novel area-masked language modeling objective (AMLM)
In TMLM, tokens are randomly masked, and the model predicts the masked tokens using spatial information and other unmasked tokens.
AMLM is a 2D version of TMLM.
