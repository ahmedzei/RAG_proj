Train with a script
Along with the ðŸ¤— Transformers notebooks, there are also example scripts demonstrating how to train a model for a task with PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX/Flax.
You will also find scripts we've used in our research projects and legacy examples which are mostly community contributed.
