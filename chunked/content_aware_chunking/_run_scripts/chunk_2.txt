To help you with this, most of the scripts fully expose how data is preprocessed, allowing you to edit it as necessary for your use case.
For any feature you'd like to implement in an example script, please discuss it on the forum or in an issue before submitting a Pull Request. While we welcome bug fixes, it is unlikely we will merge a Pull Request that adds more functionality at the cost of readability.
This guide will show you how to run an example summarization training script in PyTorch and TensorFlow.
