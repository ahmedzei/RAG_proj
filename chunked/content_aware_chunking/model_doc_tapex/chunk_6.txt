One can directly plug in the weights of TAPEX into a BART model. 
TAPEX has checkpoints on the hub that are either pre-trained only, or fine-tuned on WTQ, SQA, WikiSQL and TabFact.
Sentences + tables are presented to the model as sentence + " " + linearized table. The linearized table has the following format: 
  col: col1 | col2 | col 3 row 1 : val1 | val2 | val3 row 2 : .
TAPEX has its own tokenizer, that allows to prepare all data for the model easily.
