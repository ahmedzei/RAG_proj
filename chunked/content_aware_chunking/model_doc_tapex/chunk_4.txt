TAPEX addresses the data scarcity challenge via guiding the language model to mimic a SQL
executor on the diverse, large-scale and high-quality synthetic corpus. We evaluate TAPEX on four benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
TAPEX outperforms previous table pre-training approaches by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them.
