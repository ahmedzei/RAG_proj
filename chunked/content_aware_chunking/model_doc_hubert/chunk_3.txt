HuBERT relies primarily on the consistency of the unsupervised
clustering step rather than the intrinsic quality of the assigned cluster labels. Starting with a simple k-means
teacher of 100 clusters, and using two iterations of clustering, the HuBERT model either matches or improves upon the
state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 performance on the Librispeech (960h) and Libri-light (60,000h) benchmarks with 10min, 1h,
10h, 100h, and 960h fine-tuning subsets.
