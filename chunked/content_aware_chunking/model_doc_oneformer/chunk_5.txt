Usage tips

OneFormer requires two inputs during inference: image and task token. 
During training, OneFormer only uses panoptic annotations.
If you want to train the model in a distributed environment across multiple nodes, then one should update the
  get_num_masks function inside in the OneFormerLoss class of modeling_oneformer.py.
