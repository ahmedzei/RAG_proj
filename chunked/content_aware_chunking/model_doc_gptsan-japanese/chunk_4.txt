(The original GPTSAN repository calls it hybrid)
In GPTSAN, the Prefix part of Prefix-LM, that is, the input position that can be referenced by both tokens, can be specified with any length.
Arbitrary lengths can also be specified differently for each batch.
This length applies to the text entered in prefix_text for the tokenizer.
The tokenizer returns the mask of the Prefix part of Prefix-LM as token_type_ids.
The model treats the part where token_type_ids is 1 as a Prefix part, that is, the input can refer to both tokens before and after.
Usage tips
Specifying the Prefix part is done with a mask passed to self-attention.
When token_type_ids=None or all zero, it is equivalent to regular causal mask
for example:

x_token = tokenizer("ｱｲｳｴ")
input_ids:      | SOT | SEG | ｱ | ｲ | ｳ | ｴ |
token_type_ids: | 1   | 0   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
prefix_lm_mask:
SOT | 1 0 0 0 0 0 |
SEG | 1 1 0 0 0 0 |
ｱ   | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |
ｲ   | 1 1 1 1 0 0 |
ｳ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |
ｴ   | 1 1 1 1 1 1 |
x_token = tokenizer("", prefix_text="ｱｲｳｴ")
input_ids:      | SOT | ｱ | ｲ | ｳ | ｴ | SEG |
token_type_ids: | 1   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0  |
prefix_lm_mask:
SOT | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |
ｱ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |
ｲ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |
ｳ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |
ｴ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |
SEG | 1 1 1 1 1 1 |
x_token = tokenizer("ｳｴ", prefix_text="ｱｲ")
input_ids:      | SOT | ｱ | ｲ | SEG | ｳ | ｴ |
token_type_ids: | 1   | 1 | 1 | 0   | 0 | 0 |
prefix_lm_mask:
SOT | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |
ｱ   | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |
ｲ   | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |
SEG | 1 1 1 1 0 0 |
ｳ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |
ｴ   | 1 1 1 1 1 1 |

Spout Vector
A Spout Vector is a special vector for controlling text generation.
This vector is treated as the first embedding in self-attention to bring extraneous attention to the generated tokens.
In the pre-trained model published from Tanrei/GPTSAN-japanese, the Spout Vector is a 128-dimensional vector that passes through 8 fully connected layers in the model and is projected into the space acting as external attention.
The Spout Vector projected by the fully connected layer is split to be passed to all self-attentions.
