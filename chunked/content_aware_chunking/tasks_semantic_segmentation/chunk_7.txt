In this guide, you'll use the ColorJitter function from torchvision to randomly change the color properties of an image, but you can also use any image library you like.

from torchvision.transforms import ColorJitter
jitter = ColorJitter(brightness=0.25, contrast=0.25, saturation=0.25, hue=0.1)

Now create two preprocessing functions to prepare the images and annotations for the model. These functions convert the images into pixel_values and annotations to labels.
