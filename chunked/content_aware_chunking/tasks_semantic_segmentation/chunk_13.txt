You can quickly load an evaluation method with the ðŸ¤— Evaluate library. For this task, load the mean Intersection over Union (IoU) metric (see the ðŸ¤— Evaluate quick tour to learn more about how to load and compute a metric):

import evaluate
metric = evaluate.load("mean_iou")

Then create a function to [~evaluate.EvaluationModule.compute] the metrics.
