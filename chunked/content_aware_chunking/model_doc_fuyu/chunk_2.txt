With 8 billion parameters and licensed under CC-BY-NC, Fuyu-8B is notable for its ability to handle both text and images, its impressive context size of 16K, and its overall performance.

The Fuyu models were trained using bfloat16, but the original inference uses float16 The checkpoints uploaded on the hub use torch_dtype = 'float16' which will be
used by the AutoModel API to cast the checkpoints from torch.float32 to torch.float16.
