The default configuration is also used when no custom configuration has been saved with
the model.
When you load a model explicitly, you can inspect the generation configuration that comes with it through
 model.generation_config:
thon

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilgpt2")
model.generation_config
GenerationConfig {
    "bos_token_id": 50256,
    "eos_token_id": 50256,
}

Printing out the model.generation_config reveals only the values that are different from the default generation
configuration, and does not list any of the default values.
The default generation configuration limits the size of the output combined with the input prompt to a maximum of 20
tokens to avoid running into resource limitations.
