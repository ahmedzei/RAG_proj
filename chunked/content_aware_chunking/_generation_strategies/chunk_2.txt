If a model's preprocessor creates more than one kind of input, pass all
the inputs to generate(). You can learn more about the individual model's preprocessor in the corresponding model's documentation.
The process of selecting output tokens to generate text is known as decoding, and you can customize the decoding strategy
that the generate() method will use.
