To learn how it works, refer to Diverse Beam Search: Decoding Diverse Solutions from Neural Sequence Models.
This approach has three main parameters: num_beams, num_beam_groups, and diversity_penalty.
The diversity penalty ensures the outputs are distinct across groups, and beam search is used within each group.
