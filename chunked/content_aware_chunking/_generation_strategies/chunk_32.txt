If
do_sample=True, then the token validation with resampling introduced in the
speculative decoding paper is used.
Currently, only greedy search and sampling are supported with assisted decoding, and assisted decoding doesn't support batched inputs.
To learn more about assisted decoding, check this blog post.
To enable assisted decoding, set the assistant_model argument with a model.
