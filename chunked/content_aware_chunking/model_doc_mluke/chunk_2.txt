However, existing methods only exploit entity information in pretraining
and do not explicitly use entities in downstream tasks. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of leveraging
entity representations for downstream cross-lingual tasks. We train a multilingual language model with 24 languages
with entity representations and show the model consistently outperforms word-based pretrained models in various
cross-lingual transfer tasks.
