Note that this is a so-called probabilistic forecasting model, not a
point forecasting model. This means that the model learns a distribution, from which one can sample. The model doesn't directly output values.
[TimeSeriesTransformerForPrediction] consists of 2 blocks: an encoder, which takes a context_length of time series values as input (called past_values),
and a decoder, which predicts a prediction_length of time series values into the future (called future_values).
