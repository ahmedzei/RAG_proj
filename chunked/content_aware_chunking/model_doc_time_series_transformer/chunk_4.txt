if a given time-series value was obtained on the 11th of August, then one could have [11, 8] as time feature vector (11 being "day of the month", 8 being "month of the year").
static_categorical_features: categorical features which are static over time (i.e., have the same value for all past_values and future_values).
An example here is the store ID or region ID that identifies a given time-series.
Note that these features need to be known for ALL data points (also those in the future).
static_real_features: real-valued features which are static over time (i.e., have the same value for all past_values and future_values).
An example here is the image representation of the product for which you have the time-series values (like the ResNet embedding of a "shoe" picture,
if your time-series is about the sales of shoes).
Note that these features need to be known for ALL data points (also those in the future).

The model is trained using "teacher-forcing", similar to how a Transformer is trained for machine translation.
