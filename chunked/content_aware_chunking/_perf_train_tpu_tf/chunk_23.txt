Our tokenizers and data collators also have a pad_to_multiple_of argument that you can use to reduce the number of unique input shapes you see!

How do I actually train my model on TPU?
Once your training is XLA-compatible and (if youâ€™re using TPU Node / Colab) your dataset has been prepared appropriately, running on TPU is surprisingly easy! All you really need to change in your code is to add a few lines to initialize your TPU, and to ensure that your model and dataset are created inside a TPUStrategy scope.
