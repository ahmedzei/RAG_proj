However, we understand that the only free TPU access is on Colab and Kaggle Kernels, which uses TPU Node - so weâ€™ll try to explain how to handle it if you have to! Check the TPU example notebook for code samples that explain this in more detail.
What sizes of TPU are available?
A single TPU (a v2-8/v3-8/v4-8) runs 8 replicas. TPUs exist in pods that can run hundreds or thousands of replicas simultaneously.
