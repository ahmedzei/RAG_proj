Take a look at our TPU example notebook to see this in action!
Summary
There was a lot in here, so let’s summarize with a quick checklist you can follow when you want to get your model ready for TPU training:

Make sure your code follows the three rules of XLA
Compile your model with jit_compile=True on CPU/GPU and confirm that you can train it with XLA
Either load your dataset into memory or use a TPU-compatible dataset loading approach (see notebook)
Migrate your code either to Colab (with accelerator set to “TPU”) or a TPU VM on Google Cloud
Add TPU initializer code (see notebook)
Create your TPUStrategy and make sure dataset loading and model creation are inside the strategy.scope() (see notebook)
Don’t forget to take jit_compile=True out again when you move to TPU!

Call model.fit()
You did it!
