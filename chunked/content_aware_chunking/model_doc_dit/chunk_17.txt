To include the head, you can load the weights into a BeitForMaskedImageModeling model, like so:
thon
from transformers import BeitForMaskedImageModeling
model = BeitForMaskedImageModeling.from_pretrained("microsoft/dit-base")

You can also load a fine-tuned model from the hub, like so:
thon
from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained("microsoft/dit-base-finetuned-rvlcdip")

This particular checkpoint was fine-tuned on RVL-CDIP, an important benchmark for document image classification.
