Note that this won't include the language modeling head on top, used to predict visual tokens.
To include the head, you can load the weights into a BeitForMaskedImageModeling model, like so:
thon
from transformers import BeitForMaskedImageModeling
model = BeitForMaskedImageModeling.from_pretrained("microsoft/dit-base")

You can also load a fine-tuned model from the hub, like so:
thon
from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained("microsoft/dit-base-finetuned-rvlcdip")

This particular checkpoint was fine-tuned on RVL-CDIP, an important benchmark for document image classification.
A notebook that illustrates inference for document image classification can be found here.

A list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by ðŸŒŽ) resources to help you get started with DiT.

[BeitForImageClassification] is supported by this example script and notebook.

If you're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we'll review it! The resource should ideally demonstrate something new instead of duplicating an existing resource.

As DiT's architecture is equivalent to that of BEiT, one can refer to BEiT's documentation page for all tips, code examples and notebooks.
