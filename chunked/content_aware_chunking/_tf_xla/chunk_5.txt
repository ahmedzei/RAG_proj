We’ll also provide links to additional resources if you’re interested to learn more about the benchmarks and our design philosophy behind the XLA integration.
Running TF functions with XLA
Let us consider the following model in TensorFlow:

import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential(
    [tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), activation="relu"), tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation="softmax")]
)

The above model accepts inputs having a dimension of (10, ).
