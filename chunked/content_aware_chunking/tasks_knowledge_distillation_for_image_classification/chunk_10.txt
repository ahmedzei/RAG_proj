This function will be used during the training process to compute the accuracy & f1 of our model.
thon
import evaluate
import numpy as np
accuracy = evaluate.load("accuracy")
def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    predictions, labels = eval_pred
    acc = accuracy.compute(references=labels, predictions=np.argmax(predictions, axis=1))
    return {"accuracy": acc["accuracy"]}

Let's initialize the Trainer with the training arguments we defined.
