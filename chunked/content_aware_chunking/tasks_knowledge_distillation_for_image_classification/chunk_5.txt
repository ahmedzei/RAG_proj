Then, we divide each of them by the parameter temperature which controls the importance of each soft target. A parameter called lambda weighs the importance of the distillation loss. In this example, we will use temperature=5 and lambda=0.5. We will use the Kullback-Leibler Divergence loss to compute the divergence between the student and teacher. Given two data P and Q, KL Divergence explains how much extra information we need to represent P using Q.
