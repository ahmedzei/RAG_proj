Further documentation for downloading models can be found in the NGC documentation.
Alternatively, you can directly download the checkpoints using:
BERT-345M-uncased:

wget --content-disposition https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/nvidia/megatron_bert_345m/versions/v0.1_uncased/zip
-O megatron_bert_345m_v0_1_uncased.zip
BERT-345M-cased:

wget --content-disposition https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/nvidia/megatron_bert_345m/versions/v0.1_cased/zip -O
megatron_bert_345m_v0_1_cased.zip
Once you have obtained the checkpoints from NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC), you have to convert them to a format that will
easily be loaded by Hugging Face Transformers and our port of the BERT code.
The following commands allow you to do the conversion.
