CTC is commonly used in speech recognition tasks because speech doesn't always cleanly align with the transcript for a variety of reasons such as a speaker's different speech rates.
convolution
A type of layer in a neural network where the input matrix is multiplied element-wise by a smaller matrix (kernel or filter) and the values are summed up in a new matrix. This is known as a convolutional operation which is repeated over the entire input matrix.
