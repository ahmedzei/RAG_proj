The model updates its weights based on how incorrect its predictions were, and the process is repeated to optimize model performance.

Tensor Parallelism (TP)
Parallelism technique for training on multiple GPUs in which each tensor is split up into multiple chunks, so instead of 
having the whole tensor reside on a single GPU, each shard of the tensor resides on its designated GPU.
