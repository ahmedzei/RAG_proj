Some example stages found in a pipeline might be data preprocessing, feature extraction, and normalization.
For more details, see Pipelines for inference.
PipelineParallel (PP)
Parallelism technique in which the model is split up vertically (layer-level) across multiple GPUs, so that only one or 
several layers of the model are placed on a single GPU. Each GPU processes in parallel different stages of the pipeline 
and working on a small chunk of the batch.
