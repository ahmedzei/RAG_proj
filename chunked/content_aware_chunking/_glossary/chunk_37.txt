To gain a better idea of what preprocessing looks like for other input types, check out the Preprocess tutorial.
pretrained model
A model that has been pretrained on some data (for instance all of Wikipedia). Pretraining methods involve a
self-supervised objective, which can be reading the text and trying to predict the next word (see causal language
modeling) or masking some words and trying to predict them (see masked language
modeling). 
Speech and vision models have their own pretraining objectives.
