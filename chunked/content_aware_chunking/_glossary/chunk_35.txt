Pooling layers are commonly found between convolutional layers to downsample the feature representation.
position IDs
Contrary to RNNs that have the position of each token embedded within them, transformers are unaware of the position of
each token. Therefore, the position IDs (position_ids) are used by the model to identify each token's position in the
list of tokens.
They are an optional parameter.
