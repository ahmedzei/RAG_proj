In this work, we first draw inspiration from the recent progress in Vision Transformer (ViT) to construct a conceptually simple yet powerful vision STR model, which is built upon ViT and outperforms previous state-of-the-art models for scene text recognition, including both pure vision models and language-augmented methods. To integrate linguistic knowledge, we further propose a Multi-Granularity Prediction strategy to inject information from the language modality into the model in an implicit way, i.e.
