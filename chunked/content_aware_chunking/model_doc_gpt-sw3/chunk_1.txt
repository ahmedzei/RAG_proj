GPT-Sw3
Overview
The GPT-Sw3 model was first proposed in
Lessons Learned from GPT-SW3: Building the First Large-Scale Generative Language Model for Swedish
by Ariel Ekgren, Amaru Cuba Gyllensten, Evangelia Gogoulou, Alice Heiman, Severine Verlinden, Joey Ã–hman,
Fredrik Carlsson, Magnus Sahlgren.
Since that first paper the authors have extended their work and trained new models on their new 1.2TB corpora named The Nordic Pile.
GPT-Sw3 is a collection of large decoder-only pretrained transformer language models that were developed by AI Sweden
in collaboration with RISE and the WASP WARA for Media and Language.
