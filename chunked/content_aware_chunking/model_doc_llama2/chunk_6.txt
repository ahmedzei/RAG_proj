The dtype of the online weights is mostly irrelevant unless you are using torch_dtype="auto" when initializing a model using model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path", torch_dtype = "auto"). The reason is that the model will first be downloaded ( using the dtype of the checkpoints online), then it will be casted to the default dtype of torch (becomes torch.float32), and finally, if there is a torch_dtype provided in the config, it will be used.
