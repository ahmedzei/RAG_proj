It is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, with checkpoints finetuned for chat application!
The abstract from the paper is the following:
In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases.
