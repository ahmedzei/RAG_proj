Framing RL as sequence
modeling problem simplifies a range of design decisions, allowing us to dispense with many of the components common
in offline RL algorithms. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across long-horizon dynamics prediction,
imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and offline RL.
