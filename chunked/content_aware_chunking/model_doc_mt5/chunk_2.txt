All of the code and model
checkpoints used in this work are publicly available.
Note: mT5 was only pre-trained on mC4 excluding any supervised training.
Therefore, this model has to be fine-tuned before it is usable on a downstream task, unlike the original T5 model.
Since mT5 was pre-trained unsupervisedly, there's no real advantage to using a task prefix during single-task
fine-tuning.
