In this paper, we introduce mT5, a
multilingual variant of T5 that was pre-trained on a new Common Crawl-based dataset covering 101 languages. We detail
the design and modified training of mT5 and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance on many multilingual
benchmarks. We also describe a simple technique to prevent "accidental translation" in the zero-shot setting, where a
generative model chooses to (partially) translate its prediction into the wrong language.
