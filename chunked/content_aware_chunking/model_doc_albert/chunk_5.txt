Also, the embedding matrix is large since it's V x E (V being the vocab size). If E < H, it has less parameters.
Layers are split in groups that share parameters (to save memory).
Next sentence prediction is replaced by a sentence ordering prediction: in the inputs, we have two sentences A and B (that are consecutive) and we either feed A followed by B or B followed by A. The model must predict if they have been swapped or not.
