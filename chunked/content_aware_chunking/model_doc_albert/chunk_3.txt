We also use a
self-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks
with multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and
SQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.
