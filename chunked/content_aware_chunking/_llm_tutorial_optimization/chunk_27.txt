developed exactly such a new algorithm and called it Flash Attention.
In a nutshell, Flash Attention breaks the  \(\mathbf{V} \times \text{Softmax}(\mathbf{QK}^T\)) computation apart and instead computes smaller chunks of the output by iterating over multiple softmax computation steps:
$$ \textbf{O}i \leftarrow s^a{ij} * \textbf{O}i + s^b{ij} * \mathbf{V}{j} \times \text{Softmax}(\mathbf{QK}^T{i,j}) \text{ for multiple } i, j \text{ iterations} $$
with \( s^a_{ij} \) and \( s^b_{ij} \) being some softmax normalization statistics that need to be recomputed for every \( i \) and \( j \) .
Please note that the whole Flash Attention is a bit more complex and is greatly simplified here as going in too much depth is out of scope for this guide.
