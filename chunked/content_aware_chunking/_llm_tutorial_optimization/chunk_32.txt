Here is a function that does that.
def alternating(list1, list2):
   results = []
   for i in range(len(list1)):
       results.append(list1[i])
       results.append(list2[i])
   return results
Question: Can you write some test cases for this function?
Answer: Sure, here are some tests.
assert alternating([10, 20, 30], [1, 2, 3]) == [10, 1, 20, 2, 30, 3]
assert alternating([True, False], [4, 5]) == [True, 4, False, 5]
assert alternating([], []) == []
Question: Modify the function so that it returns all input elements when the lists have uneven length.
