It is up to the user to try it out.
Also note that inference here was again a bit slower compared to 8-bit quantization which is due to the more aggressive quantization method used for 4-bit quantization leading to \( \text{quantize} \) and \( \text{dequantize} \) taking longer during inference.

Overall, we saw that running OctoCoder in 8-bit precision reduced the required GPU VRAM from 32G GPU VRAM to only 15GB and running the model in 4-bit precision further reduces the required GPU VRAM to just a bit over 9GB.
4-bit quantization allows the model to be run on GPUs such as RTX3090, V100, and T4 which are quite accessible for most people.
For more information on quantization and to see how one can quantize models to require even less GPU VRAM memory than 4-bit, we recommend looking into the AutoGPTQ implementation.

As a conclusion, it is important to remember that model quantization trades improved memory efficiency against accuracy and in some cases inference time.

If GPU memory is not a constraint for your use case, there is often no need to look into quantization.
