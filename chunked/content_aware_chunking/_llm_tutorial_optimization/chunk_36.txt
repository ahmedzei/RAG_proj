Also the generation takes a little over a minute now.
We call flush() to free GPU memory for our next experiment.
python
flush()
For comparison, let's run the same function, but enable Flash Attention instead.
To do so, we convert the model to BetterTransformer and by doing so enabling PyTorch's SDPA self-attention which in turn is able to use Flash Attention.
python
model.to_bettertransformer()
Now we run the exact same code snippet as before and under the hood Transformers will make use of Flash Attention.

start_time = time.time()
with torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel(enable_flash=True, enable_math=False, enable_mem_efficient=False):
    result = pipe(long_prompt, max_new_tokens=60)[0]["generated_text"][len(long_prompt):]
print(f"Generated in {time.time() - start_time} seconds.")
result

Output:
Generated in 3.0211617946624756 seconds.
 Sure.
