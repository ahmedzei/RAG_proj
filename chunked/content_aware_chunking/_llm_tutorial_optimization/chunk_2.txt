This necessitates the model's capability to manage very long input sequences during inference.

The crux of these challenges lies in augmenting the computational and memory capabilities of LLMs, especially when handling expansive input sequences.
In this guide, we will go over the effective techniques for efficient LLM deployment:

Lower Precision: Research has shown that operating at reduced numerical precision, namely 8-bit and 4-bit can achieve computational advantages without a considerable decline in model performance.

Flash Attention: Flash Attention is a variation of the attention algorithm that not only provides a more memory-efficient approach but also realizes increased efficiency due to optimized GPU memory utilization.

Architectural Innovations: Considering that LLMs are always deployed in the same way during inference, namely autoregressive text generation with a long input context, specialized model architectures have been proposed that allow for more efficient inference.
