Therefore the back-of-the-envelope formula can also be understood as an "at most X GB" computation.
Note that if we had tried to run the model in full float32 precision, a whopping 64 GB of VRAM would have been required.

Almost all models are trained in bfloat16 nowadays, there is no reason to run the model in full float32 precision if your GPU supports bfloat16.
