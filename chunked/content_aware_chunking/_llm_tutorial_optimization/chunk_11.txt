Note that all memory and speed optimizations that we will apply going forward, are equally applicable to models that require model or tensor parallelism.
Since the model is loaded in bfloat16 precision, using our rule of thumb above, we would expect the memory requirement to run inference with bigcode/octocoder to be around 31 GB VRAM.
