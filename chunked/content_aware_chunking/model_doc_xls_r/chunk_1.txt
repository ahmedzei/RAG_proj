The abstract from the paper is the following:
This paper presents XLS-R, a large-scale model for cross-lingual speech representation learning based on wav2vec 2.0.
We train models with up to 2B parameters on nearly half a million hours of publicly available speech audio in 128
languages, an order of magnitude more public data than the largest known prior work.
