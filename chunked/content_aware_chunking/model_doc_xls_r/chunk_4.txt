We hope XLS-R can help to improve speech processing tasks for many more languages of the world.
Relevant checkpoints can be found under https://huggingface.co/models?other=xls_r.

Usage tips

XLS-R is a speech model that accepts a float array corresponding to the raw waveform of the speech signal.
XLS-R model was trained using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) so the model output has to be decoded using
  [Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer].

XLS-R's architecture is based on the Wav2Vec2 model, refer to Wav2Vec2's documentation page for API reference.
