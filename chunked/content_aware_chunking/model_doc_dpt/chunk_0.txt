DPT
Overview
The DPT model was proposed in Vision Transformers for Dense Prediction by Ren√© Ranftl, Alexey Bochkovskiy, Vladlen Koltun.
DPT is a model that leverages the Vision Transformer (ViT) as backbone for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We introduce dense vision transformers, an architecture that leverages vision transformers in place of convolutional networks as a backbone for dense prediction tasks.
