DeepSpeed
DeepSpeed, powered by Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO), is an optimization library for training and fitting very large models onto a GPU. It is available in several ZeRO stages, where each stage progressively saves more GPU memory by partitioning the optimizer state, gradients, parameters, and enabling offloading to a CPU or NVMe. DeepSpeed is integrated with the [Trainer] class and most of the setup is automatically taken care of for you.
