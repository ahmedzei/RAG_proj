In this work, we propose I-BERT, a novel quantization scheme for Transformer based models that quantizes
the entire inference with integer-only arithmetic. Based on lightweight integer-only approximation methods for
nonlinear operations, e.g., GELU, Softmax, and Layer Normalization, I-BERT performs an end-to-end integer-only BERT
inference without any floating point calculation. We evaluate our approach on GLUE downstream tasks using
RoBERTa-Base/Large.
