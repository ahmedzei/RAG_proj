We show that for both cases, I-BERT achieves similar (and slightly higher) accuracy as compared to
the full-precision baseline. Furthermore, our preliminary implementation of I-BERT shows a speedup of 2.4 - 4.0x for
INT8 inference on a T4 GPU system as compared to FP32 inference. The framework has been developed in PyTorch and has
been open-sourced.
