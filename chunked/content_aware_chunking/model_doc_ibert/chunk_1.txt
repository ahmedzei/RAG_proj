However, their memory footprint, inference latency, and power consumption are prohibitive for
efficient inference at the edge, and even at the data center. While quantization can be a viable solution for this,
previous work on quantizing Transformer based models use floating-point arithmetic during inference, which cannot
efficiently utilize integer-only logical units such as the recent Turing Tensor Cores, or traditional integer-only ARM
processors.
