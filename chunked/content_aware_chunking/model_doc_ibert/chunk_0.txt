I-BERT
Overview
The I-BERT model was proposed in I-BERT: Integer-only BERT Quantization by
Sehoon Kim, Amir Gholami, Zhewei Yao, Michael W. Mahoney and Kurt Keutzer. It's a quantized version of RoBERTa running
inference up to four times faster.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Transformer based models, like BERT and RoBERTa, have achieved state-of-the-art results in many Natural Language
Processing tasks.
