However, you may encounter
encoder-decoder transformer LLMs as well, for instance, Flan-T5 and BART.
Encoder-decoder-style models are typically used in generative tasks where the output heavily relies on the input, for 
example, in translation and summarization. The decoder-only models are used for all other types of generative tasks.
When using a pipeline to generate text with an LLM, it's important to know what type of LLM you are using, because 
they use different pipelines.
