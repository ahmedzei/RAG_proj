Be specific and descriptive about the task and the desired outcome - its format, length, style, language, etc.
Avoid ambiguous descriptions and instructions.
Favor instructions that say "what to do" instead of those that say "what not to do".
"Lead" the output in the right direction by writing the first word (or even begin the first sentence for the model).
Use advanced techniques like Few-shot prompting and Chain-of-thought
Test your prompts with different models to assess their robustness.
