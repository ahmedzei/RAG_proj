As a result, these models become quite powerful and versatile, and you can use 
them to solve multiple NLP tasks out of the box by instructing the models with natural language prompts.
Designing such prompts to ensure the optimal output is often called "prompt engineering". Prompt engineering is an 
iterative process that requires a fair amount of experimentation. Natural languages are much more flexible and expressive 
than programming languages, however, they can also introduce some ambiguity.
