Traditionally, gazpacho was made by pounding the vegetables in a mortar with a pestle; this more laborious method is still sometimes used as it helps keep the gazpacho cool and avoids the foam and silky consistency of smoothie versions made in blenders or food processors.
 Question: What modern tool is used to make gazpacho?
 Answer:
 """
sequences = pipe(
     prompt,
     max_new_tokens=10,
     do_sample=True,
     top_k=10,
     return_full_text = False,
 )
for seq in sequences:
     print(f"Result: {seq['generated_text']}")
Result: Modern tools are used, such as immersion blenders

Reasoning
Reasoning is one of the most difficult tasks for LLMs, and achieving good results often requires applying advanced prompting techniques, like 
Chain-of-though.
Let's try if we can make a model reason about a simple arithmetics task with a basic prompt: 
thon

torch.manual_seed(5) # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
prompt = """There are 5 groups of students in the class.
