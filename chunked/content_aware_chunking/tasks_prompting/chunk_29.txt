Few-shot prompting
The basic prompts in the sections above are the examples of "zero-shot" prompts, meaning, the model has been given 
instructions and context, but no examples with solutions. LLMs that have been fine-tuned on instruction datasets, generally 
perform well on such "zero-shot" tasks.
