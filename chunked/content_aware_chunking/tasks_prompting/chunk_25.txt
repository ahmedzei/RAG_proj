I ate 2 muffins and gave 5 muffins to a neighbor. My partner then bought 6 more muffins and ate 2. How many muffins do we now have?"""
sequences = pipe(
     prompt,
     max_new_tokens=10,
     do_sample=True,
     top_k=10,
     return_full_text = False,
 )
for seq in sequences:
     print(f"Result: {seq['generated_text']}")
Result: 
The total number of muffins now is 21

This is a wrong answer, it should be 12.
