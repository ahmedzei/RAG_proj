Translations should be similar, but not identical to output in the test set linked to in each model card.

Implementation Notes

Each model is about 298 MB on disk, there are more than 1,000 models.
The list of supported language pairs can be found here.
Models were originally trained by JÃ¶rg Tiedemann using the Marian C++ library, which supports fast training and translation.
All models are transformer encoder-decoders with 6 layers in each component.
