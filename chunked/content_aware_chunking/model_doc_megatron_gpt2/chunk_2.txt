Our
approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model
parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We
illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs.
