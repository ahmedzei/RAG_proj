We assume that the folder models/megatron_gpt2 contains
megatron_gpt2_345m_v0_0.zip and that the command is run from that folder:

python3 $PATH_TO_TRANSFORMERS/models/megatron_gpt2/convert_megatron_gpt2_checkpoint.py megatron_gpt2_345m_v0_0.zip
 
MegatronGPT2 architecture is the same as OpenAI GPT-2 . Refer to GPT-2 documentation for information on 
 configuration classes and their parameters.
