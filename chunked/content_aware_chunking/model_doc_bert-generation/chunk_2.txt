We
developed a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model that is compatible with publicly available pre-trained BERT,
GPT-2 and RoBERTa checkpoints and conducted an extensive empirical study on the utility of initializing our model, both
encoder and decoder, with these checkpoints. Our models result in new state-of-the-art results on Machine Translation,
Text Summarization, Sentence Splitting, and Sentence Fusion.
