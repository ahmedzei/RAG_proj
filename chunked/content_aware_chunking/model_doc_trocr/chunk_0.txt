TrOCR
Overview
The TrOCR model was proposed in TrOCR: Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition with Pre-trained
Models by Minghao Li, Tengchao Lv, Lei Cui, Yijuan Lu, Dinei Florencio, Cha Zhang,
Zhoujun Li, Furu Wei. TrOCR consists of an image Transformer encoder and an autoregressive text Transformer decoder to
perform optical character recognition (OCR).
