Usage tips

The quickest way to get started with TrOCR is by checking the tutorial
  notebooks, which show how to use the model
  at inference time as well as fine-tuning on custom data.
TrOCR is pre-trained in 2 stages before being fine-tuned on downstream datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art results
  on both printed (e.g. the SROIE dataset and handwritten (e.g. the IAM
  Handwriting dataset text recognition tasks.
