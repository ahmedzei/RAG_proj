not in fully bi-directional setting), use the perm_mask and
  target_mapping inputs to control the attention span and outputs (see examples in
  examples/pytorch/text-generation/run_generation.py)
XLNet is one of the few models that has no sequence length limit.
XLNet is not a traditional autoregressive model but uses a training strategy that builds on that. It permutes the tokens in the sentence, then allows the model to use the last n tokens to predict the token n+1.
