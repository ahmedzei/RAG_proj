This guide will show you how to:
- Use an image-to-image pipeline for super resolution task,
- Run image-to-image models for same task without a pipeline.
Note that as of the time this guide is released, image-to-image pipeline only supports super resolution task.
Let's begin by installing the necessary libraries.

pip install transformers
We can now initialize the pipeline with a Swin2SR model. We can then infer with the pipeline by calling it with an image.
