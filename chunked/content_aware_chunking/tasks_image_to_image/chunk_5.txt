Let's initialize the model and the processor.
thon
from transformers import Swin2SRForImageSuperResolution, Swin2SRImageProcessor 
model = Swin2SRForImageSuperResolution.from_pretrained("caidas/swin2SR-lightweight-x2-64").to(device)
processor = Swin2SRImageProcessor("caidas/swin2SR-lightweight-x2-64")

pipeline abstracts away the preprocessing and postprocessing steps that we have to do ourselves, so let's preprocess the image. We will pass the image to the processor and then move the pixel values to GPU.
