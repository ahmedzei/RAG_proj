The most common case is where 
you have a single GPU. The methods that you can apply to improve training efficiency on a single GPU extend to other setups 
such as multiple GPU. However, there are also techniques that are specific to multi-GPU or CPU training. We cover them in 
separate sections.

Methods and tools for efficient training on a single GPU: start here to learn common approaches that can help optimize GPU memory utilization, speed up the training, or both.
