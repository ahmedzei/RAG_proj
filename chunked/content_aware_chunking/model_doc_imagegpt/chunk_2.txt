Despite training on low-resolution ImageNet without labels,
we find that a GPT-2 scale model learns strong image representations as measured by linear probing, fine-tuning, and
low-data classification. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 96.3% accuracy with a linear probe, outperforming a supervised Wide
ResNet, and 99.0% accuracy with full fine-tuning, matching the top supervised pre-trained models.
