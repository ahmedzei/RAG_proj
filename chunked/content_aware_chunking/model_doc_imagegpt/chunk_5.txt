ImageGPT
  also doesn't have tied input- and output embeddings.
As the time- and memory requirements of the attention mechanism of Transformers scales quadratically in the sequence
  length, the authors pre-trained ImageGPT on smaller input resolutions, such as 32x32 and 64x64. However, feeding a
  sequence of 32x32x3=3072 tokens from 0..255 into a Transformer is still prohibitively large. Therefore, the authors
  applied k-means clustering to the (R,G,B) pixel values with k=512.
