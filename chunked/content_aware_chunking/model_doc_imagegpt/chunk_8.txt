Features can be
  easily obtained by first forwarding the image through the model, then specifying output_hidden_states=True, and
  then average-pool the hidden states at whatever layer you like.
Alternatively, one can further fine-tune the entire model on a downstream dataset, similar to BERT. For this, you can
  use [ImageGPTForImageClassification].
ImageGPT comes in different sizes: there's ImageGPT-small, ImageGPT-medium and ImageGPT-large.
