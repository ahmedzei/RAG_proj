ImageGPT (iGPT) is a GPT-2-like
model trained to predict the next pixel value, allowing for both unconditional and conditional image generation.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Inspired by progress in unsupervised representation learning for natural language, we examine whether similar models
can learn useful representations for images. We train a sequence Transformer to auto-regressively predict pixels,
without incorporating knowledge of the 2D input structure.
