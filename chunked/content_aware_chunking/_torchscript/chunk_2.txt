These models can be safely exported without the torchscript flag.
Dummy inputs and standard lengths
The dummy inputs are used for a models forward pass. While the inputs' values are
propagated through the layers, PyTorch keeps track of the different operations executed
on each tensor. These recorded operations are then used to create the trace of the
model.
The trace is created relative to the inputs' dimensions.
