Unlike other data collators in ðŸ¤— Transformers, the DefaultDataCollator does not apply additional preprocessing such as padding.

from transformers import DefaultDataCollator
data_collator = DefaultDataCollator()

To avoid overfitting and to make the model more robust, add some data augmentation to the training part of the dataset.
Here we use Keras preprocessing layers to define the transformations for the training data (includes data augmentation),
and transformations for the validation data (only center cropping, resizing and normalizing).
