It is important you don't remove unused columns because that'll drop the image column. Without the image column, you can't create pixel_values. Set remove_unused_columns=False to prevent this behavior! The only other required parameter is output_dir which specifies where to save your model. You'll push this model to the Hub by setting push_to_hub=True (you need to be signed in to Hugging Face to upload your model).
