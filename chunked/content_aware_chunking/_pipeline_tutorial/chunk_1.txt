Even if you don't have experience with a specific modality or aren't familiar with the underlying code behind the models, you can still use them for inference with the [pipeline]! This tutorial will teach you to:

Use a [pipeline] for inference.
Use a specific tokenizer or model.
Use a [pipeline] for audio, vision, and multimodal tasks.

Take a look at the [pipeline] documentation for a complete list of supported tasks and available parameters.

Pipeline usage
While each task has an associated [pipeline], it is simpler to use the general [pipeline] abstraction which contains 
all the task-specific pipelines.
