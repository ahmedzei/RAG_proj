The [pipeline] automatically loads a default model and a preprocessing class capable 
of inference for your task. Let's take the example of using the [pipeline] for automatic speech recognition (ASR), or
speech-to-text.

Start by creating a [pipeline] and specify the inference task:

from transformers import pipeline
transcriber = pipeline(task="automatic-speech-recognition")

Pass your input to the [pipeline].
