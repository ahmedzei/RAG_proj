In the example output above the first
two sections show the result corresponding to inference time and inference memory. In addition, all relevant
information about the computing environment, e.g. the GPU type, the system, the library versions, etc are printed
out in the third section under ENVIRONMENT INFORMATION. This information can optionally be saved in a .csv file
when adding the argument save_to_csv=True to [PyTorchBenchmarkArguments] and
[TensorFlowBenchmarkArguments] respectively.
