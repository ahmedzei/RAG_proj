In order to increase compatibility between tools, as well as to 
correctly render these returns in ipython (jupyter, colab, ipython notebooks, ), we implement wrapper classes
around these types.
The wrapped objects should continue behaving as initially; a text object should still behave as a string, an image
object should still behave as a PIL.Image.
These types have three specific purposes:

Calling to_raw on the type should return the underlying object
Calling to_string on the type should return the object as a string: that can be the string in case of an AgentText
  but will be the path of the serialized version of the object in other instances
Displaying it in an ipython kernel should display the object correctly
