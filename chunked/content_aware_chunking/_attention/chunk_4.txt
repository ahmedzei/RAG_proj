This is shown in Figure 2d of the paper, see below for a sample attention mask:

Using those attention matrices with less parameters then allows the model to have inputs having a bigger sequence
length.
Other tricks
Axial positional encodings
Reformer uses axial positional encodings: in traditional transformer models, the positional encoding
E is a matrix of size \(l\) by \(d\), \(l\) being the sequence length and \(d\) the dimension of the
hidden state.
