It is based on Google's BERT model released in 2018.
It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining objective and training with
much larger mini-batches and learning rates.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Language model pretraining has led to significant performance gains but careful comparison between different
approaches is challenging.
