Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes,
and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication
study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and
training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every
model published after it.
