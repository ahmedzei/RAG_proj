RoBERTa, GPT2, BERT, DistilBERT).
The effectiveness of initializing image-to-text-sequence models with pretrained checkpoints has been shown in (for
example) TrOCR: Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition with Pre-trained Models by Minghao Li, Tengchao Lv, Lei Cui, Yijuan Lu, Dinei Florencio, Cha Zhang,
Zhoujun Li, Furu Wei.
After such a [VisionEncoderDecoderModel] has been trained/fine-tuned, it can be saved/loaded just like any other models (see the examples below
for more information).
An example application is image captioning, in which the encoder is used to encode the image, after which an autoregressive language model generates
the caption.
