Overview
The XLM-ProphetNet model was proposed in ProphetNet: Predicting Future N-gram for Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training, by Yu Yan, Weizhen Qi, Yeyun Gong, Dayiheng Liu, Nan Duan, Jiusheng Chen, Ruofei
Zhang, Ming Zhou on 13 Jan, 2020.
XLM-ProphetNet is an encoder-decoder model and can predict n-future tokens for "ngram" language modeling instead of
just the next token.
