To do so, just call push_to_hub on the tool variable:
python
tool.push_to_hub("hf-model-downloads")
You now have your code on the Hub! Let's take a look at the final step, which is to have the agent use it.
Having the agent use the tool
We now have our tool that lives on the Hub which can be instantiated as such (change the user name for your tool):
thon
from transformers import load_tool
tool = load_tool("lysandre/hf-model-downloads")

In order to use it in the agent, simply pass it in the additional_tools parameter of the agent initialization method:
thon
from transformers import HfAgent
agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder", additional_tools=[tool])
agent.run(
    "Can you read out loud the name of the model that has the most downloads in the 'text-to-video' task on the Hugging Face Hub?"
)
which outputs the following:text
==Code generated by the agent==
model = model_download_counter(task="text-to-video")
print(f"The model with the most downloads is {model}.")
audio_model = text_reader(model)
==Result==
The model with the most downloads is damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b.

and generates the following audio.
| Audio                                                                                                                                            |

Depending on the LLM, some are quite brittle and require very exact prompts in order to work well.
