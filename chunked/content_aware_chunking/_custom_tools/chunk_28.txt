image generation and transformations.
A common problem is that the agent confuses image generation with image transformation/modification when 
used a lot for image generation tasks, e.g.
py
agent.run("Make an image of a house and a car", return_code=True)
returns
``text
==Explanation from the agent== 
I will use the following toolsimage_generatorto generate an image of a house andimage_transformer` to transform the image of a car into the image of a house.
==Code generated by the agent==
house_image = image_generator(prompt="A house")
car_image = image_generator(prompt="A car")
house_car_image = image_transformer(image=car_image, prompt="A house")

which is probably not exactly what we want here.
