Let's run it again.
py
agent.run("Make an image of a house and a car", return_code=True)
Now we're getting:
``text
==Explanation from the agent==
I will use the following tools:image_generatorto generate an image of a house, thenimage_generator` to generate an image of a car.
==Code generated by the agent==
house_image = image_generator(prompt="A house")
car_image = image_generator(prompt="A car")

which is definitely closer to what we had in mind! However, we want to have both the house and car in the same image.
