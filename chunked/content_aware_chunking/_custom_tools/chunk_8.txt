There are 
exactly as many bullet points as there are tools in agent.toolbox and each bullet point consists of the name 
and description of the tool:
text
- <tool.name>: <tool.description>
Let's verify this quickly by loading the document_qa tool and printing out the name and description.

from transformers import load_tool
document_qa = load_tool("document-question-answering")
print(f"- {document_qa.name}: {document_qa.description}")

which gives:
text
- document_qa: This is a tool that answers a question about a document (pdf).
