Let's have a look at one example:
```text
Task: "Identify the oldest person in thedocument` and create an image showcasing the result as a banner."
I will use the following tools: document_qa to find the oldest person in the document, then image_generator to generate an image according to the answer.
Answer:
py
answer = document_qa(document, question="What is the oldest person?")
print(f"The answer is {answer}.")
image = image_generator("A banner showing " + answer)
`
The pattern the model is prompted to repeat has three parts: The task statement, the agent's explanation of 
what it intends to do, and finally the generated code.
