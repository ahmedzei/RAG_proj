In order to handle these tools,
Langchain requires textual inputs and outputs, even when working with different modalities.
This is often the serialized version (i.e., saved to disk) of the objects.
This difference means that multi-modality isn't handled between transformers-agents and langchain.
We aim for this limitation to be resolved in future versions, and welcome any help from avid langchain
users to help us achieve this compatibility.
We would love to have better support.
