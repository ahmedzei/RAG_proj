If you want to overwrite the run prompt template, 
you can do as follows:

template = """ [] """
agent = HfAgent(your_endpoint, run_prompt_template=template)

Please make sure to have the <<all_tools>> string and the <<prompt>> defined somewhere in the template so that the agent can be aware 
of the tools, it has available to it as well as correctly insert the user's prompt.
