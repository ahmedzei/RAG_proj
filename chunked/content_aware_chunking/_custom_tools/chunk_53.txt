agent.run("Generate an image of the prompt after improving it.", prompt="A rabbit wearing a space suit")

The model adequately leverages the tool:

==Explanation from the agent==
I will use the following  tools:StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorto improve the prompt, thenimage_generator` to generate an image according to the improved prompt.
==Code generated by the agent==
improved_prompt = StableDiffusionPromptGenerator(prompt)
print(f"The improved prompt is {improved_prompt}.")
image = image_generator(improved_prompt)

Before finally generating the image:
