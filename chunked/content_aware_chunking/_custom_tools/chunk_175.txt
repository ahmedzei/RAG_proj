We first import the tool from gradio_tools and instantiate it:
thon
from gradio_tools import StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorTool
gradio_tool = StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorTool()

We pass that instance to the Tool.from_gradio method:
thon
from transformers import Tool
tool = Tool.from_gradio(gradio_tool)

Now we can manage it exactly as we would a usual custom tool.
