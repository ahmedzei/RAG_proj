Steering the task more toward single image generation should help:
py
agent.run("Create image: 'A house and car'", return_code=True)
``text
==Explanation from the agent==
I will use the following tool:image_generator` to generate an image.
==Code generated by the agent==
image = image_generator(prompt="A house and car")

Agents are still brittle for many use cases, especially when it comes to 
slightly more complex use cases like generating an image of multiple objects.
Both the agent itself and the underlying prompt will be further improved in the coming 
months making sure that agents become more robust to a variety of user inputs.

Customizing the whole prompt
To give the user maximum flexibility, the whole prompt template as explained in above
can be overwritten by the user.
