Note that the chat mode always uses the following format for the exchanges:
```text
Human: <>
Assistant:

Therefore it is important that the examples of the custom chat prompt template also make use of this format.
You can overwrite the chat template at instantiation as follows.
thon
template = """ [] """
agent = HfAgent(url_endpoint=your_endpoint, chat_prompt_template=template)

Please make sure to have the <<all_tools>> string defined somewhere in the template so that the agent can be aware 
of the tools, it has available to it.

In both cases, you can pass a repo ID instead of the prompt template if you would like to use a template hosted by someone in the community.
