Note that the only
information the agent has about the tool is its name and description, so one should make sure that both 
are precisely written and match the style of the existing tools in the toolbox. In particular make sure the description
mentions all the arguments expected by name in code-style, along with the expected type and a description of what they
are.

Check the naming and description of the curated Transformers tools to better understand what name and 
description a tool is expected to have.
