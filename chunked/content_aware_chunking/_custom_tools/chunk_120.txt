We'll start by loading the custom tools with the convenient [load_tool] function:

from transformers import load_tool
controlnet_transformer = load_tool("diffusers/controlnet-canny-tool")
upscaler = load_tool("diffusers/latent-upscaler-tool")

Upon adding custom tools to an agent, the tools' descriptions and names are automatically
included in the agents' prompts.
