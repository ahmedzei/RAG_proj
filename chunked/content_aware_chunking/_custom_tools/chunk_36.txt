To upload your custom prompt on a repo on the Hub and share it with the community just make sure:
- to use a dataset repository
- to put the prompt template for the run command in a file named run_prompt_template.txt

Using custom tools
In this section, we'll be leveraging two existing custom tools that are specific to image generation:

We replace huggingface-tools/image-transformation,
  with diffusers/controlnet-canny-tool 
  to allow for more image modifications.
We add a new tool for image upscaling to the default toolbox: 
  diffusers/latent-upscaler-tool replace the existing image-transformation tool.

We'll start by loading the custom tools with the convenient [load_tool] function:

from transformers import load_tool
controlnet_transformer = load_tool("diffusers/controlnet-canny-tool")
upscaler = load_tool("diffusers/latent-upscaler-tool")

Upon adding custom tools to an agent, the tools' descriptions and names are automatically
included in the agents' prompts.
