It takes an input named `document` which should be the document containing the information, as well as a `question` that is the question about the document. It returns a text that contains the answer to the question.
We can see that the tool name is short and precise. The description includes two parts, the first explaining 
what the tool does and the second states what input arguments and return values are expected.
A good tool name and tool description are very important for the agent to correctly use it.
