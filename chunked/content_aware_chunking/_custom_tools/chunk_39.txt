It returns the modified image.'
Name: 'image_transformer'
The name and description are accurate and fit the style of the curated set of tools.
Next, let's instantiate an agent with controlnet_transformer and upscaler:
py
tools = [controlnet_transformer, upscaler]
agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder", additional_tools=tools)
This command should give you the following info:
text
image_transformer has been replaced by <transformers_modules.diffusers.controlnet-canny-tool.bd76182c7777eba9612fc03c0
8718a60c0aa6312.image_transformation.ControlNetTransformationTool object at 0x7f1d3bfa3a00> as provided in `additional_tools`
The set of curated tools already has an image_transformer tool which is hereby replaced with our custom tool.

Overwriting existing tools can be beneficial if we want to use a custom tool exactly for the same task as an existing tool 
because the agent is well-versed in using the specific task.
