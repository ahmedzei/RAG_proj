We'll create a class that inherits from it:
thon
from transformers import Tool
class HFModelDownloadsTool(Tool):
    pass

This class has a few needs:
- An attribute name, which corresponds to the name of the tool itself. To be in tune with other tools which have a
  performative name, we'll name it model_download_counter.
- An attribute description, which will be used to populate the prompt of the agent.
- inputs and outputs attributes.
