Using Longformer self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation, which usually
represents the memory and time bottleneck, can be reduced from \(\mathcal{O}(n_s \times n_s)\) to
\(\mathcal{O}(n_s \times w)\), with \(n_s\) being the sequence length and \(w\) being the average window
size.
