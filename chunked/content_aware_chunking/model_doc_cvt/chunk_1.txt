The Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) improves the Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We present in this paper a new architecture, named Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) 
in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs.
