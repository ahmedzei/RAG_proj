It also displays surprising emergent
properties compared to phi-1-base, our model before our finetuning stage on a dataset of coding
exercises, and phi-1-small, a smaller model with 350M parameters trained with the same pipeline as
phi-1 that still achieves 45% on HumanEval.
The abstract from the Phi-1.5 paper is the following:
We continue the investigation into the power of smaller Transformer-based language models as
initiated by TinyStories – a 10 million parameter model that can produce coherent English – and
the follow-up work on phi-1, a 1.3 billion parameter model with Python coding performance close
to the state-of-the-art.
