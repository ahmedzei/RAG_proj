The output stride of the HuggingFace model is always 32.

The original TensorFlow checkpoints include quantized models. We do not support these models as they include additional "FakeQuantization" operations to unquantize the weights.

It's common to extract the output from the pointwise layers at indices 5, 11, 12, 13 for downstream purposes. Using output_hidden_states=True returns the output from all intermediate layers.
