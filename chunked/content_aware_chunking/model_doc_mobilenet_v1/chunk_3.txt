Usage tips

The checkpoints are named mobilenet_v1_depth_size, for example mobilenet_v1_1.0_224, where 1.0 is the depth multiplier (sometimes also referred to as "alpha" or the width multiplier) and 224 is the resolution of the input images the model was trained on.

Even though the checkpoint is trained on images of specific size, the model will work on images of any size.
