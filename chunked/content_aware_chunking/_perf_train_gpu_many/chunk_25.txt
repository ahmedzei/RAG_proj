Upon completion of the 7th layer, there is often 
a need to send the data back to layer 0 where the labels are (or alternatively send the labels to the last layer). Now the loss can be 
computed and the optimizer can do its work.
Naive Model Parallelism comes several shortcomings:
- All but one GPU are idle at any given moment: if 4 GPUs are used, it's nearly identical to quadrupling the amount of memory of a single GPU, and ignoring the rest of the hardware.
