fast-intra-connect/slow-inter-connect and it automatically optimizes all these algorithmically deciding which 
parallelisation to use where.
One very important aspect is that FlexFlow is designed for optimizing DNN parallelizations for models with static and 
fixed workloads, since models with dynamic behavior may prefer different parallelization strategies across iterations.
So the promise is very attractive - it runs a 30min simulation on the cluster of choice and it comes up with the best 
strategy to utilise this specific environment.
