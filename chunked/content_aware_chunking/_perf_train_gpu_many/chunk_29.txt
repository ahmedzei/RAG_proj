GPU0 performs the same 
forward path on chunk 0, 1, 2 and 3 (F0,0, F0,1, F0,2, F0,3) and then it waits for other GPUs to do complete their work. 
Only when the other GPUs begin to complete their work, GPU0 starts to work again doing the backward path for chunks 
3, 2, 1 and 0 (B0,3, B0,2, B0,1, B0,0).
Note that this is the same concept as gradient accumulation steps.
