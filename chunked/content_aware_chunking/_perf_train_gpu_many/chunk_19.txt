The reconstruction is done efficiently via a pre-fetch.
Then the whole process is repeated for layer Lb, then Lc forward-wise, and then backward Lc -> Lb -> La.

This mechanism is similar to an efficient group backpacking strategy: person A carries the tent, person B carries the stove,
and person C carries the axe. Each night they all share what they have with others and get from others what they don't have, 
and in the morning they pack up their allocated type of gear and continue on their way.
