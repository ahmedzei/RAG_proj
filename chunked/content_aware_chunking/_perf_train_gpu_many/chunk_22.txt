This approach
involves distributing groups of model layers across multiple GPUs by assigning specific layers to specific GPUs with .to(). 
As data flows through these layers, it is moved to the same GPU as the layer, while the other layers remain untouched.
We refer to this Model parallelism as "Vertical" because of how models are typically visualized.
