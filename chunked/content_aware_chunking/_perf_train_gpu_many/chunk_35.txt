Possible improvements are being discussed here https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/50693
- Conditional control flow at the level of pipe stages is not possible - e.g., Encoder-Decoder models like T5 require special workarounds to handle a conditional encoder stage.
- They have to arrange each layer so that the output of one layer becomes an input to the other layer.
More recent solutions include:
- Varuna
- Sagemaker
We have not experimented with Varuna and SageMaker but their papers report that they have overcome the list of problems 
mentioned above and that they require smaller changes to the user's model.
Implementations:
- PyTorch (initial support in pytorch-1.8, and progressively getting improved in 1.9 and more so in 1.10).
