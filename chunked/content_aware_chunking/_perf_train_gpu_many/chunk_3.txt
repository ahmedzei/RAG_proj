While the main concepts discussed in this guide are likely applicable across frameworks, here we focus on 
PyTorch-based implementations.

Before diving deeper into the specifics of each technique, let's go over the rough decision process when training 
large models on a large infrastructure.
Scalability strategy
Begin by estimating how much vRAM is required to train your model.
