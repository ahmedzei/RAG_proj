For example, the 
following diagram shows an 8-layer model split vertically into two slices, placing layers 0-3 onto 
GPU0 and 4-7 to GPU1:

| Layer |      |
|   0   |      |
|   1   | GPU0 |
|   2   |      |
|   3   |      |
================
| Layer |      |
|   4   |      |
|   5   | GPU1 |
|   6   |      |
|   7   |      |
================

In this example, when data moves from layer 0 to 3, it's no different from regular forward pass.
