Efficient Training on Multiple GPUs
If training a model on a single GPU is too slow or if the model's weights do not fit in a single GPU's memory, transitioning 
to a multi-GPU setup may be a viable option. Prior to making this transition, thoroughly explore all the strategies covered 
in the Methods and tools for efficient training on a single GPU as they are universally applicable 
to model training on any number of GPUs.
