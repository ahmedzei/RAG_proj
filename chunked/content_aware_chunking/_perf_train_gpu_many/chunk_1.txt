Once you have employed those strategies and found them insufficient for your 
case on a single GPU, consider moving to multiple GPUs.
Transitioning from a single GPU to multiple GPUs requires the introduction of some form of parallelism, as the workload 
must be distributed across the resources. Multiple techniques can be employed to achieve parallelism, such as data 
parallelism, tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism.
