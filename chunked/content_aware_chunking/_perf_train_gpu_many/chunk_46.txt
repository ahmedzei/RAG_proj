It has already been 
discussed in ZeRO Data Parallelism. Normally it's a standalone feature that doesn't require PP or TP. 
But it can be combined with PP and TP.
When ZeRO-DP is combined with PP (and optionally TP) it typically enables only ZeRO stage 1 (optimizer sharding).
While it's theoretically possible to use ZeRO stage 2 (gradient sharding) with Pipeline Parallelism, it will have negative 
performance impacts.
