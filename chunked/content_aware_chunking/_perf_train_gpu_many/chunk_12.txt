We'll benchmark the differences between DP and 
DDP with an added context of NVLink presence:  

Hardware: 2x TITAN RTX 24GB each + NVlink with 2 NVLinks (NV2 in nvidia-smi topo -m).
Software: pytorch-1.8-to-be + cuda-11.0 / transformers==4.3.0.dev0.

To disable the NVLink feature on one of the benchmarks, we use NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1.
