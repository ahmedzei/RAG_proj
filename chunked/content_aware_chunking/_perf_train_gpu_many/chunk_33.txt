The purpose of finding the best value for chunks is to enable a high 
concurrent GPU utilization across all participating GPUs which translates to minimizing the size of the bubble.
Pipeline API solutions have been implemented in:
- PyTorch
- DeepSpeed
- Megatron-LM
These come with some shortcomings:
- They have to modify the model quite heavily, because Pipeline requires one to rewrite the normal flow of modules into a nn.Sequential sequence of the same, which may require changes to the design of the model.
- Currently the Pipeline API is very restricted.
