ViLT incorporates text embeddings into a Vision Transformer (ViT), allowing it to have a minimal design
for Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP).
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP) has improved performance on various joint vision-and-language downstream tasks.
Current approaches to VLP heavily rely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region supervision
(e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g., ResNet).
