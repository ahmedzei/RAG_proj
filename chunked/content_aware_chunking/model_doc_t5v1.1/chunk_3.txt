Since t5v1.1 was pre-trained unsupervisedly, there's no real advantage to using a task prefix during single-task
fine-tuning. If you are doing multi-task fine-tuning, you should use a prefix.
Google has released the following variants:

google/t5-v1_1-small

google/t5-v1_1-base

google/t5-v1_1-large

google/t5-v1_1-xl

google/t5-v1_1-xxl.

Refer to T5's documentation page for all API reference, tips, code examples and notebooks.
