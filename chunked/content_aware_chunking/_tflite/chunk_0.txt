Export to TFLite
TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight framework for deploying machine learning models 
on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones, embedded systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
TFLite is designed to optimize and run models efficiently on these devices with limited computational power, memory, and 
power consumption.
A TensorFlow Lite model is represented in a special efficient portable format identified by the .tflite file extension.
