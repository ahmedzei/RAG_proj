TAPAS is pre-trained on the masked language modeling (MLM) objective on a large dataset comprising 
millions of tables from English Wikipedia and corresponding texts. 
For question answering, TAPAS has 2 heads on top: a cell selection head and an aggregation head, for (optionally) performing aggregations (such as counting or summing) among selected cells.
