TAPAS has been fine-tuned on several datasets: 
- SQA (Sequential Question Answering by Microsoft)
- WTQ (Wiki Table Questions by Stanford University)
- WikiSQL (by Salesforce). 
It achieves state-of-the-art on both SQA and WTQ, while having comparable performance to SOTA on WikiSQL, with a much simpler architecture.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Answering natural language questions over tables is usually seen as a semantic parsing task.
