Note that the forward pass of TAPAS is a bit different in case of a conversational set-up: in that case, you have to feed every table-question pair one by one to the model, such that the prev_labels token type ids can be overwritten by the predicted labels of the model to the previous question. See "Usage" section for more info.
TAPAS is similar to BERT and therefore relies on the masked language modeling (MLM) objective.
