TAPAS
Overview
The TAPAS model was proposed in TAPAS: Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via Pre-training
by Jonathan Herzig, Paweł Krzysztof Nowak, Thomas Müller, Francesco Piccinno and Julian Martin Eisenschlos. It's a BERT-based model specifically 
designed (and pre-trained) for answering questions about tabular data. Compared to BERT, TAPAS uses relative position embeddings and has 7 
token types that encode tabular structure.
