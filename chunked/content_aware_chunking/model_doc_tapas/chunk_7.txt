The authors of TAPAS call this further pre-training intermediate pre-training (since TAPAS is first pre-trained on MLM, and then on another dataset). They found that intermediate pre-training further improves performance on SQA, achieving a new state-of-the-art as well as state-of-the-art on TabFact, a large-scale dataset with 16k Wikipedia tables for table entailment (a binary classification task).
