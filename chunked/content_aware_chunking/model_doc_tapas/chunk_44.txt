making predictions on new data). For inference, onlyinput_ids,attention_maskandtoken_type_ids(which you can obtain using [TapasTokenizer]) have to be provided to the model to obtain the logits. Next, you can use the handy [~models.tapas.tokenization_tapas.convert_logits_to_predictions`] method to convert these into predicted coordinates and optional aggregation indices.

However, note that inference is different depending on whether or not the setup is conversational.
