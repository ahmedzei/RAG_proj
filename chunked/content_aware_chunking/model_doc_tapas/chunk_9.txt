Note that this is something that was added after the publication of the original TAPAS paper. According to the authors, this usually results in a slightly better performance, and allows you to encode longer sequences without running out of embeddings. This is reflected in the reset_position_index_per_cell parameter of [TapasConfig], which is set to True by default. The default versions of the models available on the hub all use relative position embeddings.
