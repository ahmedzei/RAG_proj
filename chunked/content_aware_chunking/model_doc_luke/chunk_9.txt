By
    using Wikipedia entities as input tokens, LUKE outputs token representations enriched by the information stored in
    the embeddings of these entities. This is particularly effective for tasks requiring real-world knowledge, such as
    question answering.

There are three head models for the former use case:

[LukeForEntityClassification], for tasks to classify a single entity in an input text such as
    entity typing, e.g.
