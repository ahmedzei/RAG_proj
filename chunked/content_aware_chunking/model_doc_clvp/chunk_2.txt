Usage tips

CLVP is an integral part of the Tortoise TTS model.
CLVP can be used to compare different generated speech candidates with the provided text, and the best speech tokens are forwarded to the diffusion model.
The use of the [ClvpModelForConditionalGeneration.generate()] method is strongly recommended for tortoise usage.
Note that the CLVP model expects the audio to be sampled at 22.05 kHz contrary to other audio models which expects 16 kHz.
