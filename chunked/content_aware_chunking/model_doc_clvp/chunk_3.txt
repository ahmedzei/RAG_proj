Brief Explanation:

The [ClvpTokenizer] tokenizes the text input, and the [ClvpFeatureExtractor] extracts the log mel-spectrogram from the desired audio.
[ClvpConditioningEncoder] takes those text tokens and audio representations and converts them into embeddings conditioned on the text and audio.
The [ClvpForCausalLM] uses those embeddings to generate multiple speech candidates.
Each speech candidate is passed through the speech encoder ([ClvpEncoder]) which converts them into a vector representation, and the text encoder ([ClvpEncoder]) converts the text tokens into the same latent space.
