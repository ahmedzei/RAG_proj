Recent efforts try to reduce the computation 
complexity of ViT through network architecture search or hybrid design with MobileNet block, yet the inference speed is still 
unsatisfactory. This leads to an important question: can transformers run as fast as MobileNet while obtaining high performance? 
To answer this, we first revisit the network architecture and operators used in ViT-based models and identify inefficient designs.
