The pre-trained model and training pipeline are publicly released to facilitate research into neural response
generation and the development of more intelligent open-domain dialogue systems.

Usage tips

DialoGPT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather
  than the left.
DialoGPT was trained with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective on conversational data and is therefore powerful
  at response generation in open-domain dialogue systems.
DialoGPT enables the user to create a chat bot in just 10 lines of code as shown on DialoGPT's model card.

Training:
In order to train or fine-tune DialoGPT, one can use causal language modeling training.
