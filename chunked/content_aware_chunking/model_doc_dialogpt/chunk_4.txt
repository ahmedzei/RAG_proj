To cite the official paper: We
follow the OpenAI GPT-2 to model a multiturn dialogue session as a long text and frame the generation task as language
modeling. We first concatenate all dialog turns within a dialogue session into a long text x_1,, x_N (N is the
sequence length), ended by the end-of-text token. For more information please confer to the original paper.

DialoGPT's architecture is based on the GPT2 model, refer to GPT2's documentation page for API reference and examples.
