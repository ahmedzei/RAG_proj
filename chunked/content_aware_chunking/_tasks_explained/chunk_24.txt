There are fewer activation and normalization layers,  the activation function is switched to GELU instead of ReLU, and it uses LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm.

The output from the convolution blocks is passed to a classification head which converts the outputs into logits and calculates the cross-entropy loss to find the most likely label.
Object detection
DETR, DEtection TRansformer, is an end-to-end object detection model that combines a CNN with a Transformer encoder-decoder.

A pretrained CNN backbone takes an image, represented by its pixel values, and creates a low-resolution feature map of it.
