The CTC loss is calculated between the logits and targets to find the most likely sequence of tokens, which are then decoded into a transcription.

Computer vision
There are two ways to approach computer vision tasks:

Split an image into a sequence of patches and process them in parallel with a Transformer.
Use a modern CNN, like ConvNeXT, which relies on convolutional layers but adopts modern network designs.

A third approach mixes Transformers with convolutions (for example, Convolutional Vision Transformer or LeViT).
