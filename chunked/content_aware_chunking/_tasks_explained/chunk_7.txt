The model has to predict the true quantized speech representation of the masked prediction from a set of false ones, encouraging the model to find the most similar context vector and quantized speech unit (the target label).

Now that wav2vec2 is pretrained, you can finetune it on your data for audio classification or automatic speech recognition!
Audio classification
To use the pretrained model for audio classification, add a sequence classification head on top of the base Wav2Vec2 model.
