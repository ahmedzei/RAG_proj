Between convolutional layers, it is common to add a pooling layer to reduce dimensionality and make the model more robust to variations of a feature's position.

ConvNeXT modernizes a CNN in five ways:

Change the number of blocks in each stage and "patchify" an image with a larger stride and corresponding kernel size.
