Then it slides over to the next window of pixels; the distance the convolution travels is known as the stride. 

A basic convolution without padding or stride, taken from A guide to convolution arithmetic for deep learning.
You can feed this output to another convolutional layer, and with each successive layer, the network learns more complex and abstract things like hotdogs or rockets.
