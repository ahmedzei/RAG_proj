BERT also adds a segment embedding to denote whether a token belongs to the first or second sentence in a pair of sentences.

BERT is pretrained with two objectives: masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction. In masked language modeling, some percentage of the input tokens are randomly masked, and the model needs to predict these. This solves the issue of bidirectionality, where the model could cheat and see all the words and "predict" the next word.
