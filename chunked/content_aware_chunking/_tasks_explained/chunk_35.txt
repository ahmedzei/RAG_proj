The sigmoid cross-entropy and dice loss is calculated between the logits and the ground truth mask to find the most likely mask.

Depth estimation
GLPN, Global-Local Path Network, is a Transformer for depth estimation that combines a SegFormer encoder with a lightweight decoder.

Like ViT, an image is split into a sequence of patches, except these image patches are smaller.
