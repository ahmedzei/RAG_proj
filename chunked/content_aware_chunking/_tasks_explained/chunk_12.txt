We won't discuss those because they just combine the two approaches we examine here.

ViT and ConvNeXT are commonly used for image classification, but for other vision tasks like object detection, segmentation, and depth estimation, we'll look at DETR, Mask2Former and GLPN, respectively; these models are better suited for those tasks.
Image classification
ViT and ConvNeXT can both be used for image classification; the main difference is that ViT uses an attention mechanism while ConvNeXT uses convolutions.
Transformer
ViT replaces convolutions entirely with a pure Transformer architecture.
