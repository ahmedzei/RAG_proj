After training on an extended version of the
PhraseCut dataset, our system generates a binary segmentation map for an image based on a free-text prompt or on
an additional image expressing the query. We analyze different variants of the latter image-based prompts in detail.
This novel hybrid input allows for dynamic adaptation not
only to the three segmentation tasks mentioned above, but
to any binary segmentation task where a text or image query
can be formulated.
