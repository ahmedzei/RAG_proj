PyTorch training on Apple silicon
Previously, training models on a Mac was limited to the CPU only. With the release of PyTorch v1.12, you can take advantage of training models with Apple's silicon GPUs for significantly faster performance and training. This is powered in PyTorch by integrating Apple's Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) as a backend.
