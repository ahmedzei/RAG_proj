With the mps device set, you can:

train larger networks or batch sizes locally
reduce data retrieval latency because the GPU's unified memory architecture allows direct access to the full memory store
reduce costs because you don't need to train on cloud-based GPUs or add additional local GPUs

Get started by making sure you have PyTorch installed.
