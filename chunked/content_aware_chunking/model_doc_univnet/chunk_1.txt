a vocoder). Only the generator is required for inference. The discriminator used to train the generator is not implemented.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Most neural vocoders employ band-limited mel-spectrograms to generate waveforms. If full-band spectral features are used as the input, the vocoder can be provided with as much acoustic information as possible.
