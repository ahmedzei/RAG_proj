In order automaticallay handle the device on which the model should execute, use accelerate.
Contrary to the paper, the order of the priors goes from 0 to 1 as it felt more intuitive : we sample starting from 0.
Primed sampling (conditioning the sampling on raw audio) requires more memory than ancestral sampling and should be used with fp16 set to True.

This model was contributed by Arthur Zucker.
