wav2vec 2.0 masks
the speech input in the latent space and solves a contrastive task defined over a quantization of the latent
representations which are jointly learned. Experiments using all labeled data of Librispeech achieve 1.8/3.3 WER on the
clean/other test sets. When lowering the amount of labeled data to one hour, wav2vec 2.0 outperforms the previous state
of the art on the 100 hour subset while using 100 times less labeled data.
