logging vs warnings
Python has two logging systems that are often used in conjunction: logging, which is explained above, and warnings,
which allows further classification of warnings in specific buckets, e.g., FutureWarning for a feature or path
that has already been deprecated and DeprecationWarning to indicate an upcoming deprecation.
