Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention
with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of
tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard
sequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than
standard self-attention.
