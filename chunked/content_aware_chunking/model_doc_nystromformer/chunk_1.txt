A key component
that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or
dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the
input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the
community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr√∂mformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a
function of sequence length.
