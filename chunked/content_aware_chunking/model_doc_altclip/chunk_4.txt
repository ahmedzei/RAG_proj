Note that we use bidirectional attention instead of casual attention
and we take the [CLS] token in XLM-R to represent text embedding.
AltCLIP is a multi-modal vision and language model. It can be used for image-text similarity and for zero-shot image
classification. AltCLIP uses a ViT like transformer to get visual features and a bidirectional language model to get the text
features. Both the text and visual features are then projected to a latent space with identical dimension.
