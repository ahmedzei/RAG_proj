It can be
instructed in natural language to predict the most relevant text snippet, given an image, without directly optimizing
for the task, similarly to the zero-shot capabilities of GPT-2 and 3.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This
restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify
any other visual concept.
