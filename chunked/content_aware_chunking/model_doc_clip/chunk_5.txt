Usage tips and example
CLIP is a multi-modal vision and language model. It can be used for image-text similarity and for zero-shot image
classification. CLIP uses a ViT like transformer to get visual features and a causal language model to get the text
features. Both the text and visual features are then projected to a latent space with identical dimension.
