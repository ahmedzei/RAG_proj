The authors
also add absolute position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of vectors to a standard Transformer encoder.
The [CLIPImageProcessor] can be used to resize (or rescale) and normalize images for the model.
The [CLIPTokenizer] is used to encode the text. The [CLIPProcessor] wraps
[CLIPImageProcessor] and [CLIPTokenizer] into a single instance to both
encode the text and prepare the images.
