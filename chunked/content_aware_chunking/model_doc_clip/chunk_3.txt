After pre-training, natural language is used to reference
learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study
the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks
such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification.
