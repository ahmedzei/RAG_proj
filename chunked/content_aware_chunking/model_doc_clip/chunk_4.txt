The
model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need
for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot
without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained
model weights at this https URL.
