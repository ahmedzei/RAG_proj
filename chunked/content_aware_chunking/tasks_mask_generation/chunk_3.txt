In this guide, you will learn how to:
- Infer in segment everything mode with batching,
- Infer in point prompting mode,
- Infer in box prompting mode.
First, let's install transformers:

pip install -q transformers
Mask Generation Pipeline
The easiest way to infer mask generation models is to use the mask-generation pipeline.
thon

from transformers import pipeline
checkpoint = "facebook/sam-vit-base"
mask_generator = pipeline(model=checkpoint, task="mask-generation")

Let's see the image.
thon
from PIL import Image
import requests
img_url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/bee.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(img_url, stream=True).raw).convert("RGB")

Let's segment everything.
