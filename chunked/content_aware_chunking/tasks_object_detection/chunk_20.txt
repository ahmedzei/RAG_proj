Upon training completion, push the final model to the Hub as well by calling the [~transformers.Trainer.push_to_hub] method.

trainer.push_to_hub()

Evaluate
Object detection models are commonly evaluated with a set of COCO-style metrics.
You can use one of the existing metrics implementations, but here you'll use the one from torchvision to evaluate the final
model that you pushed to the Hub.
To use the torchvision evaluator, you'll need to prepare a ground truth COCO dataset.
