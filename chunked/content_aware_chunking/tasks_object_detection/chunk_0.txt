Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:

pip install -q datasets transformers evaluate timm albumentations
You'll use ðŸ¤— Datasets to load a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub, ðŸ¤— Transformers to train your model,
and albumentations to augment the data. timm is currently required to load a convolutional backbone for the DETR model.
We encourage you to share your model with the community.
