These values are crucial
to replicate when doing inference or finetuning a pre-trained image model.
Instantiate the image processor from the same checkpoint as the model you want to finetune.

from transformers import AutoImageProcessor
checkpoint = "facebook/detr-resnet-50"
image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

Before passing the images to the image_processor, apply two preprocessing transformations to the dataset:
- Augmenting images
- Reformatting annotations to meet DETR expectations
First, to make sure the model does not overfit on the training data, you can apply image augmentation with any data augmentation library.
