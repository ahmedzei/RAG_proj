For this reason, set remove_unused_columns to False.
If you wish to share your model by pushing to the Hub, set push_to_hub to True (you must be signed in to Hugging
Face to upload your model).

from transformers import TrainingArguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
     output_dir="detr-resnet-50_finetuned_cppe5",
     per_device_train_batch_size=8,
     num_train_epochs=10,
     fp16=True,
     save_steps=200,
     logging_steps=50,
     learning_rate=1e-5,
     weight_decay=1e-4,
     save_total_limit=2,
     remove_unused_columns=False,
     push_to_hub=True,
 )

Finally, bring everything together, and call [~transformers.Trainer.train]:

from transformers import Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
     model=model,
     args=training_args,
     data_collator=collate_fn,
     train_dataset=cppe5["train"],
     tokenizer=image_processor,
 )
trainer.train()

If you have set push_to_hub to True in the training_args, the training checkpoints are pushed to the
Hugging Face Hub.
