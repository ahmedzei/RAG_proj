This means that finetuning this model will
require at least one GPU.
Training involves the following steps:
1. Load the model with [AutoModelForObjectDetection] using the same checkpoint as in the preprocessing.
2. Define your training hyperparameters in [TrainingArguments].
3. Pass the training arguments to [Trainer] along with the model, dataset, image processor, and data collator.
4.
