As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification.
We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of
application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable
to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect
to the speed/accuracy tradeoff.
