Note that one should use [LevitImageProcessor] in order to
  prepare images for the model.
[LevitForImageClassificationWithTeacher] currently supports only inference and not training or fine-tuning.
You can check out demo notebooks regarding inference as well as fine-tuning on custom data here
  (you can just replace [ViTFeatureExtractor] by [LevitImageProcessor] and [ViTForImageClassification] by [LevitForImageClassification] or [LevitForImageClassificationWithTeacher]).
