For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU. *

Usage tips

Compared to ViT, LeViT models use an additional distillation head to effectively learn from a teacher (which, in the LeViT paper, is a ResNet like-model). The distillation head is learned through backpropagation under supervision of a ResNet like-model.
