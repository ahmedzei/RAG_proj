In that case, the prediction head is trained using regular cross-entropy between
  the prediction of the head and the ground-truth label, while the distillation prediction head is trained using hard distillation
  (cross-entropy between the prediction of the distillation head and the label predicted by the teacher). At inference time,
  one takes the average prediction between both heads as final prediction.
