LeViT improves the Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by a few architectural differences such as activation maps with decreasing resolutions in Transformers and the introduction of an attention bias to integrate positional information.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
*We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy
and efficiency in a high-speed regime.
