The raw waveform should be pre-processed with [Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor].
The models were trained using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) so the model output has to be decoded using
  [Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer].
You can load different language adapter weights for different languages via [~Wav2Vec2PreTrainedModel.load_adapter].
