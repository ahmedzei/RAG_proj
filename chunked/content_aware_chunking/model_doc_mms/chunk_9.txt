All available checkpoints can be found on the Hugging 
Face Hub: facebook/mms-tts, and the inference 
documentation under VITS.

pip install --upgrade transformers accelerate
Since the flow-based model in VITS is non-deterministic, it is good practice to set a seed to ensure reproducibility of 
the outputs.
