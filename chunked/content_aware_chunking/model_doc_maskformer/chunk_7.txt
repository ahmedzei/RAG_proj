When training on multiple nodes, this should be
  set to the average number of target masks across all nodes, as can be seen in the original implementation here.
One can use [MaskFormerImageProcessor] to prepare images for the model and optional targets for the model.
To get the final segmentation, depending on the task, you can call [~MaskFormerImageProcessor.post_process_semantic_segmentation] or [~MaskFormerImageProcessor.post_process_panoptic_segmentation].
