This leads to an efficient sampling scheme to estimate self-attention which relies on specific modifications of 
LSH (to enable deployment on GPU architectures). We evaluate our algorithm on the GLUE benchmark with standard 512 sequence 
length where we see favorable performance relative to a standard pretrained Transformer.
