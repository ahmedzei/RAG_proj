YOSO
Overview
The YOSO model was proposed in You Only Sample (Almost) Once: Linear Cost Self-Attention Via Bernoulli Sampling
by Zhanpeng Zeng, Yunyang Xiong, Sathya N. Ravi, Shailesh Acharya, Glenn Fung, Vikas Singh. YOSO approximates standard softmax self-attention
via a Bernoulli sampling scheme based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). In principle, all the Bernoulli random variables can be sampled with
a single hash.
