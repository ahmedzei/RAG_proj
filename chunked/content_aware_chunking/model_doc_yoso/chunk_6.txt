Using these
hash codes, the lsh_cumulation function approximates self-attention via LSH-based Bernoulli sampling.
To use the custom kernels, the user should set config.use_expectation = False. To ensure that the kernels are compiled successfully, 
the user must install the correct version of PyTorch and cudatoolkit. By default, config.use_expectation = True, which uses YOSO-E and 
does not require compiling CUDA kernels.
