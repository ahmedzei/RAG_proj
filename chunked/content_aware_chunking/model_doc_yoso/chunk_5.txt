Usage tips

The YOSO attention algorithm is implemented through custom CUDA kernels, functions written in CUDA C++ that can be executed multiple times
in parallel on a GPU.
The kernels provide a fast_hash function, which approximates the random projections of the queries and keys using the Fast Hadamard Transform.
