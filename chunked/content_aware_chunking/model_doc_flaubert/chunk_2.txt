In this paper, we introduce and share FlauBERT, a model learned on a very large and
heterogeneous French corpus. Models of different sizes are trained using the new CNRS (French National Centre for
Scientific Research) Jean Zay supercomputer. We apply our French language models to diverse NLP tasks (text
classification, paraphrasing, natural language inference, parsing, word sense disambiguation) and show that most of the
time they outperform other pretraining approaches.
