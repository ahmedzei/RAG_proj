Leveraging the huge amount of unlabeled texts nowadays available, they provide an efficient way
to pre-train continuous word representations that can be fine-tuned for a downstream task, along with their
contextualization at the sentence level. This has been widely demonstrated for English using contextualized
representations (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al.,
2019; Yang et al., 2019b).
