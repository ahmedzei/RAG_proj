When output_hidden_states = True,
it will output both hidden_states and reshaped_hidden_states.
The reshaped_hidden_states have a shape of (batch, num_channels, height, width) rather than
(batch_size, height, width, num_channels).

Notes:
- NAT depends on NATTEN's implementation of Neighborhood Attention.
You can install it with pre-built wheels for Linux by referring to shi-labs.com/natten,
or build on your system by running pip install natten.
Note that the latter will likely take time to compile.
