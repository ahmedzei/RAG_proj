We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA
that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive;
NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9%
ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size.
