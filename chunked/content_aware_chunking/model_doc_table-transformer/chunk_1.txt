The authors train 2 DETR models, one for table detection and one for table structure recognition, dubbed Table Transformers.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Recently, significant progress has been made applying machine learning to the problem of table structure inference and extraction from unstructured documents.
However, one of the greatest challenges remains the creation of datasets with complete, unambiguous ground truth at scale.
