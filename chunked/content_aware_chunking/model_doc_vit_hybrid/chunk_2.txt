ViT hybrid is a slight variant of the plain Vision Transformer,
by leveraging a convolutional backbone (specifically, BiT) whose features are used as initial "tokens" for the Transformer.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its
applications to computer vision remain limited.
