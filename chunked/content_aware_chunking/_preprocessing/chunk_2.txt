A tokenizer splits text into tokens according to a set of rules. The tokens are converted into numbers and then tensors, which become the model inputs. Any additional inputs required by the model are added by the tokenizer.

If you plan on using a pretrained model, it's important to use the associated pretrained tokenizer.
