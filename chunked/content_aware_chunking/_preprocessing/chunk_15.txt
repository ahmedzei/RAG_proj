When padding textual data, a 0 is added for shorter sequences. The same idea applies to audio data. The feature extractor adds a 0 - interpreted as silence - to array.
Load the feature extractor with [AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained]:

from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor
feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base")

Pass the audio array to the feature extractor.
