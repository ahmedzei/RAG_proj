You can get creative in how you augment your data - adjust brightness and colors, crop, rotate, resize, zoom, etc. However, be mindful not to change the meaning of the images with your augmentations.
Image preprocessing guarantees that the images match the modelâ€™s expected input format. When fine-tuning a computer vision model, images must be preprocessed exactly as when the model was initially trained.

You can use any library you like for image augmentation.
