In this tutorial, you'll learn that for:

Text, use a Tokenizer to convert text into a sequence of tokens, create a numerical representation of the tokens, and assemble them into tensors.
Speech and audio, use a Feature extractor to extract sequential features from audio waveforms and convert them into tensors.
Image inputs use a ImageProcessor to convert images into tensors.
Multimodal inputs, use a Processor to combine a tokenizer and a feature extractor or image processor.

AutoProcessor always works and automatically chooses the correct class for the model you're using, whether you're using a tokenizer, image processor, feature extractor or processor.

Before you begin, install ðŸ¤— Datasets so you can load some datasets to experiment with:

pip install datasets
Natural Language Processing

The main tool for preprocessing textual data is a tokenizer.
