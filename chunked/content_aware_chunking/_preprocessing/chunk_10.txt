The feature extractor is designed to extract features from raw audio data, and convert them into tensors.
Load the MInDS-14 dataset (see the ðŸ¤— Datasets tutorial for more details on how to load a dataset) to see how you can use a feature extractor with audio datasets:

from datasets import load_dataset, Audio
dataset = load_dataset("PolyAI/minds14", name="en-US", split="train")

Access the first element of the audio column to take a look at the input.
