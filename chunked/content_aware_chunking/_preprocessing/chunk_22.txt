For image preprocessing, use the ImageProcessor associated with the model.

Load the food101 dataset (see the ðŸ¤— Datasets tutorial for more details on how to load a dataset) to see how you can use an image processor with computer vision datasets:

Use ðŸ¤— Datasets split parameter to only load a small sample from the training split since the dataset is quite large!

from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("food101", split="train[:100]")

Next, take a look at the image with ðŸ¤— Datasets Image feature:

dataset[0]["image"]

Load the image processor with [AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained]:

from transformers import AutoImageProcessor
image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("google/vit-base-patch16-224")

First, let's add some image augmentation.
