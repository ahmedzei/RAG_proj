If you do not resize images during image augmentation,
leave this parameter out. By default, ImageProcessor will handle the resizing.
If you wish to normalize images as a part of the augmentation transformation, use the image_processor.image_mean,
and image_processor.image_std values.

Then use ðŸ¤— Datasets[~datasets.Dataset.set_transform] to apply the transforms on the fly:

dataset.set_transform(transforms)

Now when you access the image, you'll notice the image processor has added pixel_values.
