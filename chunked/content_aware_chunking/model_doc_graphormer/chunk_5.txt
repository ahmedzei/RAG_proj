Usage tips
This model will not work well on large graphs (more than 100 nodes/edges), as it will make the memory explode.
You can reduce the batch size, increase your RAM, or decrease the UNREACHABLE_NODE_DISTANCE parameter in algos_graphormer.pyx, but it will be hard to go above 700 nodes/edges.
This model does not use a tokenizer, but instead a special collator during training.
