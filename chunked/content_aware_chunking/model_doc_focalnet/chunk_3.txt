Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively.
