This paper introduces a separable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. O(k). A simple yet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses element-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice for resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTV2, is state-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object classification and MS-COCO object detection.
