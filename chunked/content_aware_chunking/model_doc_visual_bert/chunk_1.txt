VisualBERT
Overview
The VisualBERT model was proposed in VisualBERT: A Simple and Performant Baseline for Vision and Language by Liunian Harold Li, Mark Yatskar, Da Yin, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Kai-Wei Chang.
VisualBERT is a neural network trained on a variety of (image, text) pairs.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We propose VisualBERT, a simple and flexible framework for modeling a broad range of vision-and-language tasks.
VisualBERT consists of a stack of Transformer layers that implicitly align elements of an input text and regions in an
associated input image with self-attention.
