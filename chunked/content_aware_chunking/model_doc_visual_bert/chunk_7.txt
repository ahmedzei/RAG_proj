The authors use the features generated after passing these regions through a pre-trained
CNN like ResNet as visual embeddings. They also add absolute position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of
vectors to a standard BERT model. The text input is concatenated in the front of the visual embeddings in the embedding
layer, and is expected to be bound by [CLS] and a [SEP] tokens, as in BERT.
