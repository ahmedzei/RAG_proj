In
this paper, we present LayoutXLM, a multimodal pre-trained model for multilingual document understanding, which aims to
bridge the language barriers for visually-rich document understanding. To accurately evaluate LayoutXLM, we also
introduce a multilingual form understanding benchmark dataset named XFUN, which includes form understanding samples in
7 languages (Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese), and key-value pairs are manually labeled
for each language.
