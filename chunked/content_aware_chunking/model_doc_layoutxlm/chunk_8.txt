Usage tips and examples
One can directly plug in the weights of LayoutXLM into a LayoutLMv2 model, like so:
thon
from transformers import LayoutLMv2Model
model = LayoutLMv2Model.from_pretrained("microsoft/layoutxlm-base")

Note that LayoutXLM has its own tokenizer, based on
[LayoutXLMTokenizer]/[LayoutXLMTokenizerFast].
