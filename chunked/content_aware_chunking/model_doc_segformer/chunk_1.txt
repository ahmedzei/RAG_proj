The model consists of a hierarchical Transformer encoder and a lightweight all-MLP decode head to achieve great
results on image segmentation benchmarks such as ADE20K and Cityscapes.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with
lightweight multilayer perception (MLP) decoders.
