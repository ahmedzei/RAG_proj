Usage tips

SegFormer consists of a hierarchical Transformer encoder, and a lightweight all-MLP decoder head.
  [SegformerModel] is the hierarchical Transformer encoder (which in the paper is also referred to
  as Mix Transformer or MiT). [SegformerForSemanticSegmentation] adds the all-MLP decoder head on
  top to perform semantic segmentation of images. In addition, there's
  [SegformerForImageClassification] which can be used to - you guessed it - classify images.
