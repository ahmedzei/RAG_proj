One can also check out the blog post introducing SegFormer and illustrating how it can be fine-tuned on custom data.
TensorFlow users should refer to this repository that shows off-the-shelf inference and fine-tuning.
One can also check out this interactive demo on Hugging Face Spaces
  to try out a SegFormer model on custom images.
SegFormer works on any input size, as it pads the input to be divisible by config.patch_sizes.
One can use [SegformerImageProcessor] to prepare images and corresponding segmentation maps
  for the model.
