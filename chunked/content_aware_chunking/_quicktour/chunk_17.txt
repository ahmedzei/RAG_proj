The only difference is selecting the correct [TFAutoModel] for the task. For text (or sequence) classification, you should load [TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification`]:

from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification
model_name = "nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment"
tf_model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

See the task summary for tasks supported by an [AutoModel] class.

Now pass your preprocessed batch of inputs directly to the model.
