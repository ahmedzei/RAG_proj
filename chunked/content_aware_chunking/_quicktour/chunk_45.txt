For text (or sequence) classification, you should load [TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification`]:

from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification
model_name = "nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment"
tf_model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

See the task summary for tasks supported by an [AutoModel] class.
