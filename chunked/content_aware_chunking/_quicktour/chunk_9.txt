Take a look at our finetuning tutorial to learn how. Finally, after you've finetuned your pretrained model, please consider sharing the model with the community on the Hub to democratize machine learning for everyone! ðŸ¤—
AutoClass

Under the hood, the [AutoModelForSequenceClassification] and [AutoTokenizer] classes work together to power the [pipeline] you used above. An AutoClass is a shortcut that automatically retrieves the architecture of a pretrained model from its name or path.
