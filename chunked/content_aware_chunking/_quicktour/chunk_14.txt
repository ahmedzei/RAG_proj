For text (or sequence) classification, you should load [AutoModelForSequenceClassification]:

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
model_name = "nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment"
pt_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

See the task summary for tasks supported by an [AutoModel] class.

Now pass your preprocessed batch of inputs directly to the model.
