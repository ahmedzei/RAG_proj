This allows you to customize features such as the loss function, optimizer, and scheduler. Take a look at the [Trainer] reference for which methods can be subclassed. 
The other way to customize the training loop is by using Callbacks. You can use callbacks to integrate with other libraries and inspect the training loop to report on progress or stop the training early. Callbacks do not modify anything in the training loop itself.
