Now you can use the classifier on your target text:

classifier("We are very happy to show you the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.")
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]

If you have more than one input, pass your inputs as a list to the [pipeline] to return a list of dictionaries:

results = classifier(["We are very happy to show you the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.", "We hope you don't hate it."])
for result in results:
     print(f"label: {result['label']}, with score: {round(result['score'], 4)}")
label: POSITIVE, with score: 0.9998
label: NEGATIVE, with score: 0.5309

The [pipeline] can also iterate over an entire dataset for any task you like.
