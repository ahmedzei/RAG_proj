Resources
A list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by ðŸŒŽ) resources to help you get started with ViTMAE.

[ViTMAEForPreTraining] is supported by this example script, allowing you to pre-train the model from scratch/further pre-train the model on custom data.
A notebook that illustrates how to visualize reconstructed pixel values with [ViTMAEForPreTraining] can be found here.

If you're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we'll review it! The resource should ideally demonstrate something new instead of duplicating an existing resource.
