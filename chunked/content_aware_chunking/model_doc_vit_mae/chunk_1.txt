The paper shows that, by pre-training a Vision Transformer (ViT) to reconstruct pixel values for masked patches, one can get results after
fine-tuning that outperform supervised pre-training.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the
input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs.
