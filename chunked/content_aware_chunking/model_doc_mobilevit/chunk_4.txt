Usage tips

MobileViT is more like a CNN than a Transformer model. It does not work on sequence data but on batches of images. Unlike ViT, there are no embeddings. The backbone model outputs a feature map. You can follow this tutorial for a lightweight introduction.
One can use [MobileViTImageProcessor] to prepare images for the model.
