The TensorFlow versions of the MobileViT models are fully compatible with TensorFlow Lite.

You can use the following code to convert a MobileViT checkpoint (be it image classification or semantic segmentation) to generate a
  TensorFlow Lite model:

from transformers import TFMobileViTForImageClassification
import tensorflow as tf
model_ckpt = "apple/mobilevit-xx-small"
model = TFMobileViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained(model_ckpt)
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [
    tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS,
    tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT_TF_OPS,
]
tflite_model = converter.convert()
tflite_filename = model_ckpt.split("/")[-1] + ".tflite"
with open(tflite_filename, "wb") as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)

The resulting model will be just about an MB making it a good fit for mobile applications where resources and network
  bandwidth can be constrained.
