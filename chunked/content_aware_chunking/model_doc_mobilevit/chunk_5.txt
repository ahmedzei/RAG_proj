Note that if you do your own preprocessing, the pretrained checkpoints expect images to be in BGR pixel order (not RGB).
The available image classification checkpoints are pre-trained on ImageNet-1k (also referred to as ILSVRC 2012, a collection of 1.3 million images and 1,000 classes).
The segmentation model uses a DeepLabV3 head. The available semantic segmentation checkpoints are pre-trained on PASCAL VOC.
As the name suggests MobileViT was designed to be performant and efficient on mobile phones.
