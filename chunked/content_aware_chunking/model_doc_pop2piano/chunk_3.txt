To leverage
the power of the data-driven approach, we make a large amount of
paired and synchronized {Pop, Piano Cover} data using an automated
pipeline. In this paper, we present Pop2Piano, a Transformer network
that generates piano covers given waveforms of pop music. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first model to generate a piano cover
directly from pop audio without using melody and chord extraction
modules.
