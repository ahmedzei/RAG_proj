In the original model it is possible to use an average pooling layer with a fixed 7x7 window and stride 1 instead of global pooling. For inputs that are larger than the recommended image size, this gives a pooled output that is larger than 1x1. The Hugging Face implementation does not support this.

The original TensorFlow checkpoints include quantized models.
