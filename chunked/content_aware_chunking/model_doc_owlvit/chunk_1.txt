It can be used to query an image with one or multiple text queries to search for and detect target objects described in text.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Combining simple architectures with large-scale pre-training has led to massive improvements in image classification. For object detection, pre-training and scaling approaches are less well established, especially in the long-tailed and open-vocabulary setting, where training data is relatively scarce.
