Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of
applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and
improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.

"Language models of protein sequences at the scale of evolution enable accurate structure prediction" is
Large language models have recently been shown to develop emergent capabilities with scale, going beyond
simple pattern matching to perform higher level reasoning and generate lifelike images and text.
