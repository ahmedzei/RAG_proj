In the life sciences, the
anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling
at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To
this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250
million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity.
