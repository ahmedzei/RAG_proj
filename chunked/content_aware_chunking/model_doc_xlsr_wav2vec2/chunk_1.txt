We build on wav2vec 2.0 which is trained by solving a contrastive task over
masked latent speech representations and jointly learns a quantization of the latents shared across languages. The
resulting model is fine-tuned on labeled data and experiments show that cross-lingual pretraining significantly
outperforms monolingual pretraining. On the CommonVoice benchmark, XLSR shows a relative phoneme error rate reduction
of 72% compared to the best known results.
