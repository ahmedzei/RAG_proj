The following example shows how to perform object detection using [Owlv2Processor] and [Owlv2ForObjectDetection].
thon

import requests
from PIL import Image
import torch
from transformers import Owlv2Processor, Owlv2ForObjectDetection
processor = Owlv2Processor.from_pretrained("google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble")
model = Owlv2ForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble")
url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)
texts = [["a photo of a cat", "a photo of a dog"]]
inputs = processor(text=texts, images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
Target image sizes (height, width) to rescale box predictions [batch_size, 2]
target_sizes = torch.Tensor([image.size[::-1]])
Convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits) to Pascal VOC Format (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)
results = processor.post_process_object_detection(outputs=outputs, target_sizes=target_sizes, threshold=0.1)
i = 0  # Retrieve predictions for the first image for the corresponding text queries
text = texts[i]
boxes, scores, labels = results[i]["boxes"], results[i]["scores"], results[i]["labels"]
for box, score, label in zip(boxes, scores, labels):
     box = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]
     print(f"Detected {text[label]} with confidence {round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}")
Detected a photo of a cat with confidence 0.614 at location [341.67, 17.54, 642.32, 278.51]
Detected a photo of a cat with confidence 0.665 at location [6.75, 38.97, 326.62, 354.85]

A demo notebook on using OWLv2 for zero- and one-shot (image-guided) object detection can be found here.
Zero-shot object detection task guide

The architecture of OWLv2 is identical to OWL-ViT, however the object detection head now also includes an objectness classifier, which predicts the (query-agnostic) likelihood that a predicted box contains an object (as opposed to background).
