The following implementation details are shared with Mistral AI's first model mistral:
* Sliding Window Attention - Trained with 8k context length and fixed cache size, with a theoretical attention span of 128K tokens
* GQA (Grouped Query Attention) - allowing faster inference and lower cache size.
* Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer - ensures that characters are never mapped to out of vocabulary tokens.
They also provide an instruction fine-tuned model: mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1 which can be used for chat-based inference.

Usage tips
Mixtral-8x7B can be found on the Huggingface Hub
These ready-to-use checkpoints can be downloaded and used via the HuggingFace Hub:
thon

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1")
prompt = "My favourite condiment is"
model_inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors="pt").to(device)
model.to(device)
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]
"The expected output"

To use the raw checkpoints with HuggingFace you can use the convert_mixtral_weights_to_hf.py script to convert them to the HuggingFace format:

python src/transformers/models/mixtral/convert_mixtral_weights_to_hf.py \
    --input_dir /path/to/downloaded/mistral/weights --output_dir /output/path
You can then load the converted model from the output/path:
thon
from transformers import MixtralForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer
tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("/output/path")
model = MixtralForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/output/path")

Combining Mixtral and Flash Attention 2
First, make sure to install the latest version of Flash Attention 2 to include the sliding window attention feature.

pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
Make also sure that you have a hardware that is compatible with Flash-Attention 2.
