To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that
reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and
is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our
theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having O(1) global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire
sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism.
