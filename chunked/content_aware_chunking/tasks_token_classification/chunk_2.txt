Convert the numbers to their label names to find out what the entities are:

label_list = wnut["train"].features[f"ner_tags"].feature.names
label_list
[
    "O",
    "B-corporation",
    "I-corporation",
    "B-creative-work",
    "I-creative-work",
    "B-group",
    "I-group",
    "B-location",
    "I-location",
    "B-person",
    "I-person",
    "B-product",
    "I-product",
]

The letter that prefixes each ner_tag indicates the token position of the entity:

B- indicates the beginning of an entity.
I- indicates a token is contained inside the same entity (for example, the State token is a part of an entity like
  Empire State Building).
0 indicates the token doesn't correspond to any entity.

Preprocess

The next step is to load a DistilBERT tokenizer to preprocess the tokens field:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")

As you saw in the example tokens field above, it looks like the input has already been tokenized.
