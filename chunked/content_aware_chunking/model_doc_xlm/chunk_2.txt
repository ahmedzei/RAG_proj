We
propose two methods to learn cross-lingual language models (XLMs): one unsupervised that only relies on monolingual
data, and one supervised that leverages parallel data with a new cross-lingual language model objective. We obtain
state-of-the-art results on cross-lingual classification, unsupervised and supervised machine translation. On XNLI, our
approach pushes the state of the art by an absolute gain of 4.9% accuracy.
