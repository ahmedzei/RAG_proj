Make sure to add the new quantizer and quantization config in the quantization auto-mapping in src/transformers/quantizers/auto.py.

Define the following class attributes/property methods for your quantization method:

requires_calibration: Whether the quantization method requires a data calibration process. If set to True, you can only support inference (with quantized weights) and not inference and quantization.

required_packages: A list of strings of the required packages to use the quantized weights.
