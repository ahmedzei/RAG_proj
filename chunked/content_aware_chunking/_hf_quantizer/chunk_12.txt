This method enables implementing additional features that require manipulating the model after loading the weights.

Document everything! Make sure your quantization method is documented in the docs/source/en/quantization.md file.

Add tests! You should add tests by first adding the package in our nightly Dockerfile inside docker/transformers-all-latest-gpu and then adding a new test file in tests/quantization/xxx. Feel free to check out how it is implemented for other quantization methods.
