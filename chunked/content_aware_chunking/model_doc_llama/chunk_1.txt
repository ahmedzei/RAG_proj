It is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
*We introduce LLaMA, a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible datasets.
