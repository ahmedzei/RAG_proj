Here is an example in MobileBertForSequenceClassification with the comment:

Copied from transformers.models.bert.modeling_bert.BertForSequenceClassification with Bert->MobileBert all-casing

In this case, the code is copied from BertForSequenceClassification by replacing:
- Bert by MobileBert (for instance when using MobileBertModel in the init)
- bert by mobilebert (for instance when defining self.mobilebert)
- BERT by MOBILEBERT (in the constant MOBILEBERT_INPUTS_DOCSTRING).
