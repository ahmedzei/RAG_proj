You can see here this is done with the comment:

Copied from transformers.models.roberta.modeling_roberta.RobertaForMaskedLM with Roberta->Camembert, ROBERTA->CAMEMBERT

If the order matters (because one of the replacements might conflict with a previous one), the replacements are executed from left to right.

If the replacements change the formatting (if you replace a short name by a very long name for instance), the copy is checked after applying the auto-formatter.

Another way when the patterns are just different casings of the same replacement (with an uppercased and a lowercased variants) is just to add the option all-casing.
