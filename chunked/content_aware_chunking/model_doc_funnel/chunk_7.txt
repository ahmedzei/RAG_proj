That's why there are two versions of each checkpoint. The version suffixed with “-base” contains only the three blocks, while the version without that suffix contains the three blocks and the upsampling head with its additional layers.
The Funnel Transformer checkpoints are all available with a full version and a base version. The first ones should be
  used for [FunnelModel], [FunnelForPreTraining],
  [FunnelForMaskedLM], [FunnelForTokenClassification] and
  [FunnelForQuestionAnswering].
