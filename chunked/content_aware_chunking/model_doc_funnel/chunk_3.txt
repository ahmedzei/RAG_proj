importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further
improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining
objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence
via a decoder.
