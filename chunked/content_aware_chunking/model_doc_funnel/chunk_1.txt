It is a bidirectional transformer model, like
BERT, but with a pooling operation after each block of layers, a bit like in traditional convolutional neural networks
(CNN) in computer vision.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
With the success of language pretraining, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient architectures of good
scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost.
