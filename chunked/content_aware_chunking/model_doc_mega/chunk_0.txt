MEGA
Overview
The MEGA model was proposed in Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention by Xuezhe Ma, Chunting Zhou, Xiang Kong, Junxian He, Liangke Gui, Graham Neubig, Jonathan May, and Luke Zettlemoyer.
MEGA proposes a new approach to self-attention with each encoder layer having a multi-headed exponential moving average in addition to a single head of standard dot-product attention, giving the attention mechanism 
stronger positional biases.
