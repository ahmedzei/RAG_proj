See Appendix D in the MEGA paper for examples of architectural specs which perform well in various settings. If using MEGA as a decoder, be sure to set bidirectional=False to avoid errors with default bidirectional. 
Mega-chunk is a variant of mega that reduces time and spaces complexity from quadratic to linear.
