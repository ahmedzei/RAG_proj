Donut
Overview
The Donut model was proposed in OCR-free Document Understanding Transformer by
Geewook Kim, Teakgyu Hong, Moonbin Yim, Jeongyeon Nam, Jinyoung Park, Jinyeong Yim, Wonseok Hwang, Sangdoo Yun, Dongyoon Han, Seunghyun Park.
Donut consists of an image Transformer encoder and an autoregressive text Transformer decoder to perform document understanding
tasks such as document image classification, form understanding and visual question answering.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Understanding document images (e.g., invoices) is a core but challenging task since it requires complex functions such as reading text and a holistic understanding of the document.
