At Hugging Face, we're trying to empower more of the community to actively add models and we've put together this guide to walk you through the process of adding a PyTorch model (make sure you have PyTorch installed).

If you're interested in implementing a TensorFlow model, take a look at the How to convert a ðŸ¤— Transformers model to TensorFlow guide!

Along the way, you'll:

get insights into open-source best practices
understand the design principles behind one of the most popular deep learning libraries
learn how to efficiently test large models
learn how to integrate Python utilities like black, ruff, and make fix-copies to ensure clean and readable code

A Hugging Face team member will be available to help you along the way so you'll never be alone.
