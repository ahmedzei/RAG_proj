If you are familiar with Jupyter notebooks, we strongly recommend you work with them.
The obvious disadvantage of Jupyter notebooks is that if you are not used to working with them you will have to spend
some time adjusting to the new programming environment and you might not be able to use your known debugging tools
anymore, like ipdb.
For each code-base, a good first step is always to load a small pretrained checkpoint and to be able to reproduce a
single forward pass using a dummy integer vector of input IDs as an input.
