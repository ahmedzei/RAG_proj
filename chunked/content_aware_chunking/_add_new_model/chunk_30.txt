self-attention, cross-attention?
How can you debug the model in the original environment of the repo? Do you have to add print statements, can you
  work with an interactive debugger like ipdb, or should you use an efficient IDE to debug the model, like PyCharm?

It is very important that before you start the porting process, you can efficiently debug code in the original
repository! Also, remember that you are working with an open-source library, so do not hesitate to open an issue, or
even a pull request in the original repository.
