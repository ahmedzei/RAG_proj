Usually, the tokenizer is equivalent to or very similar to an
already existing tokenizer of ðŸ¤— Transformers.
It is very important to find/extract the original tokenizer file and to manage to load this file into the ðŸ¤—
Transformers' implementation of the tokenizer.
To ensure that the tokenizer works correctly, it is recommended to first create a script in the original repository
that inputs a string and returns the `input_ids``.
