you should add statements like:
python
assert (
    model_pointer.weight.shape == pretrained_weight.shape
), f"Pointer shape of random weight {model_pointer.shape} and array shape of checkpoint weight {pretrained_weight.shape} mismatched"
Besides, you should also print out the names of both weights to make sure they match, e.g.
