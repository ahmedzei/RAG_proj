Whenever a question or problem has been solved,
you can click on the “Resolve” button of the created comment.
In the same way, the Hugging Face team will open comments when reviewing your code. We recommend asking most questions
on GitHub on your PR. For some very general questions that are not very useful for the public, feel free to ping the
Hugging Face team by Slack or email.
