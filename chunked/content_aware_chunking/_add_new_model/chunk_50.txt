You have two choices here:

transformers-cli add-new-model-like to add a new model like an existing one
transformers-cli add-new-model to add a new model from our template (will look like BERT or Bart depending on the type of model you select)

In both cases, you will be prompted with a questionnaire to fill in the basic information of your model.
