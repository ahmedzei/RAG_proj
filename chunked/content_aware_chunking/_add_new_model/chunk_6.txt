For exemplary purposes, we will
call the model to be added to ðŸ¤— Transformers BrandNewBert.
Let's take a look:

As you can see, we do make use of inheritance in ðŸ¤— Transformers, but we keep the level of abstraction to an absolute
minimum. There are never more than two levels of abstraction for any model in the library. BrandNewBertModel
inherits from BrandNewBertPreTrainedModel which in turn inherits from [PreTrainedModel] and
that's it.
