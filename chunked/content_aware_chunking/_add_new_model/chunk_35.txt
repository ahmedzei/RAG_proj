Such a script could look like this (in
pseudocode):
python
model = BrandNewBertModel.load_pretrained_checkpoint("/path/to/checkpoint/")
input_ids = [0, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7, 9]  # vector of input ids
original_output = model.predict(input_ids)
Next, regarding the debugging strategy, there are generally a few from which to choose from:

Decompose the original model into many small testable components and run a forward pass on each of those for
  verification
Decompose the original model only into the original tokenizer and the original model, run a forward pass on
  those, and use intermediate print statements or breakpoints for verification

Again, it is up to you which strategy to choose.
