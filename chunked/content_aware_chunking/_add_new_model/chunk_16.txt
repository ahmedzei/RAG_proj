Note that it might very well happen that your model's tokenizer is based on one model implementation, and
  your model's modeling code on another one. E.g. FSMT's modeling code is based on BART, while FSMT's tokenizer code
  is based on XLM.
It's more of an engineering challenge than a scientific challenge.
