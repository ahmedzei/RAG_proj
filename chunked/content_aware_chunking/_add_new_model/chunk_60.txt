advised to add a first unclean, copy-pasted version of the original code to
src/transformers/models/brand_new_bert/modeling_brand_new_bert.py until you feel like all the necessary code is
added. From our experience, it is much more efficient to quickly add a first version of the required code and
improve/correct the code iteratively with the conversion script as described in the next section.
