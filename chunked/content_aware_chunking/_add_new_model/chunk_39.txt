For such libraries, one
often relies on verifying print statements.
No matter which strategy you choose, the recommended procedure is often the same that you should start to debug the
starting layers first and the ending layers last.
It is recommended that you retrieve the output, either by print statements or sub-component functions, of the following
layers in the following order:

Retrieve the input IDs passed to the model
Retrieve the word embeddings
Retrieve the input of the first Transformer layer
Retrieve the output of the first Transformer layer
Retrieve the output of the following n - 1 Transformer layers
Retrieve the output of the whole BrandNewBert Model

Input IDs should thereby consists of an array of integers, e.g.
