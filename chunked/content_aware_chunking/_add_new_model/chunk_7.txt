As a general rule, we want to make sure that a new model only depends on
[PreTrainedModel]. The important functionalities that are automatically provided to every new
model are [~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained] and
[~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained], which are used for serialization and deserialization. All of the
other important functionalities, such as BrandNewBertModel.forward should be completely defined in the new
modeling_brand_new_bert.py script.
