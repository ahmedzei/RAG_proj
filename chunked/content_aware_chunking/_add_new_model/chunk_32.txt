Only
at the very end, when the model has already been successfully ported to ðŸ¤— Transformers, one should verify that the
model also works as expected on GPU.
In general, there are two possible debugging environments for running the original model

Jupyter notebooks / google colab
Local python scripts.

Jupyter notebooks have the advantage that they allow for cell-by-cell execution which can be helpful to better split
logical components from one another and to have faster debugging cycles as intermediate results can be stored.
