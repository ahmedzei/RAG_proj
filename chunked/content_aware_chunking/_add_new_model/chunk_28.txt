You need to
figure out the following:

Where to find the pretrained weights?
How to load the pretrained weights into the corresponding model?
How to run the tokenizer independently from the model?
Trace one forward pass so that you know which classes and functions are required for a simple forward pass. Usually,
  you only have to reimplement those functions.
Be able to locate the important components of the model: Where is the model's class? Are there model sub-classes,
  e.g.
