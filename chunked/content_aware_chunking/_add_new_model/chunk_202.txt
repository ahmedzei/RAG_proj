the
following command should work:
thon
from transformers import BrandNewBertModel, BrandNewBertConfig
model = BrandNewBertModel(BrandNewBertConfig())

The above command will create a model according to the default parameters as defined in BrandNewBertConfig() with
random weights, thus making sure that the init() methods of all components works.
