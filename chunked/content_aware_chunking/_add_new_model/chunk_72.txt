We can print the model to see its architecture
thon
model = SimpleModel()
print(model)

This will print out the following:
SimpleModel(
  (dense): Linear(in_features=10, out_features=10, bias=True)
  (intermediate): Linear(in_features=10, out_features=10, bias=True)
  (layer_norm): LayerNorm((10,), eps=1e-05, elementwise_affine=True)
)
We can see that the layer names are defined by the name of the class attribute in PyTorch.
