Adapt the generated models code for brand_new_bert
At first, we will focus only on the model itself and not care about the tokenizer. All the relevant code should be
found in the generated files src/transformers/models/brand_new_bert/modeling_brand_new_bert.py and
src/transformers/models/brand_new_bert/configuration_brand_new_bert.py.
Now you can finally start coding :).
