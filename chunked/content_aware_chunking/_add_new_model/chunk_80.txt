Implement the forward pass
Having managed to correctly load the pretrained weights into the ðŸ¤— Transformers implementation, you should now make
sure that the forward pass is correctly implemented. In Get familiar with the original repository, you have already created a script that runs a forward
pass of the model using the original repository. Now you should write an analogous script using the ðŸ¤— Transformers
implementation instead of the original one.
