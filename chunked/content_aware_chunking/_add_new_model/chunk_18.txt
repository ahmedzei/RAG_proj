In the following, we try to give you a general recipe that we found most useful when porting a model to 🤗 Transformers.
The following list is a summary of everything that has to be done to add a model and can be used by you as a To-Do
List:
☐ (Optional) Understood the model's theoretical aspects
☐ Prepared 🤗 Transformers dev environment
☐ Set up debugging environment of the original repository
☐ Created script that successfully runs the forward() pass using the original repository and checkpoint
☐ Successfully added the model skeleton to 🤗 Transformers
☐ Successfully converted original checkpoint to 🤗 Transformers checkpoint
☐ Successfully ran forward() pass in 🤗 Transformers that gives identical output to original checkpoint
☐ Finished model tests in 🤗 Transformers
☐ Successfully added tokenizer in 🤗 Transformers
☐ Run end-to-end integration tests
☐ Finished docs
☐ Uploaded model weights to the Hub
☐ Submitted the pull request
☐ (Optional) Added a demo notebook
To begin with, we usually recommend starting by getting a good theoretical understanding of BrandNewBert.
