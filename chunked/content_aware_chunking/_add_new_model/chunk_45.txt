Ideally, you want to
  find the function in the original repository that only calls a single forward pass, i.e. that is often called
  predict, evaluate, forward or __call__. You don't want to debug a function that calls forward
  multiple times, e.g. to generate text, like autoregressive_sample, generate.
Try to separate the tokenization from the model's forward pass.
