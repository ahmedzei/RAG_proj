If that's the case make sure to install the Deep Learning framework you are working with
(PyTorch, TensorFlow and/or Flax) then do:

pip install -e ".[quality]"
which should be enough for most use cases. You can then return to the parent directory

cd ..

We recommend adding the PyTorch version of brand_new_bert to Transformers. To install PyTorch, please follow the
   instructions on https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

Note: You don't need to have CUDA installed.
