11. Add Docstring
Now, all the necessary functionality for brand_new_bert is added - you're almost done! The only thing left to add is
a nice docstring and a doc page. The Cookiecutter should have added a template file called
docs/source/model_doc/brand_new_bert.md that you should fill out. Users of your model will usually first look at
this page before using your model.
