the
following command should work:
thon
from transformers import BrandNewBertModel, BrandNewBertConfig
model = BrandNewBertModel(BrandNewBertConfig())

The above command will create a model according to the default parameters as defined in BrandNewBertConfig() with
random weights, thus making sure that the init() methods of all components works.
Note that all random initialization should happen in the _init_weights method of your BrandnewBertPreTrainedModel
class.
