If you want to reuse a block from another model, copy the code and paste it with a
   # Copied from comment on top (see here
   for a good example and there for more documentation on Copied from). 
The code should be fully understandable, even by a non-native English speaker. This means you should pick
   descriptive variable names and avoid abbreviations.
