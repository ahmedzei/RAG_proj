a source-to-target-translation pair, an article-to-summary pair, a question-to-answer pair, etcâ€¦ If none
of the ported checkpoints has been fine-tuned on a downstream task it is enough to simply rely on the model tests. In a
final step to ensure that the model is fully functional, it is advised that you also run all tests on GPU. It can
happen that you forgot to add some .to(self.device) statements to internal tensors of the model, which in such a
test would show in an error.
