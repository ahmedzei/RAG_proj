Calling
[~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained] will automatically call
[~PretrainedConfig.save_pretrained], so that both model and configuration are saved.
Code style
When coding your new model, keep in mind that Transformers is an opinionated library and we have a few quirks of our
own regarding how code should be written :-)

The forward pass of your model should be fully written in the modeling file while being fully independent of other
   models in the library.
