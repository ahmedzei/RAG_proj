However, it could also be that
PyTorch's implementation of a layer requires the weight to be transposed beforehand.
Finally, you should also check that all required weights are initialized and print out all checkpoint weights that
were not used for initialization to make sure the model is correctly converted. It is completely normal, that the
conversion trials fail with either a wrong shape statement or a wrong name assignment.
