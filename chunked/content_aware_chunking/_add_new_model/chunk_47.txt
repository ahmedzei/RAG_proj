This might mean that you have to possibly write a small script yourself or change the
  original code so that you can directly input the ids instead of an input string.
Make sure that the model in your debugging setup is not in training mode, which often causes the model to yield
  random outputs due to multiple dropout layers in the model. Make sure that the forward pass in your debugging
  environment is deterministic so that the dropout layers are not used.
