It could look similar to this (in pseudo-code):
python
input_str = "This is a long example input string containing special characters .$?-, numbers 2872 234 12 and words."
model = BrandNewBertModel.load_pretrained_checkpoint("/path/to/checkpoint/")
input_ids = model.tokenize(input_str)
You might have to take a deeper look again into the original repository to find the correct tokenizer function or you
might even have to do changes to your clone of the original repository to only output the input_ids.
