Because the models are random it's
impossible to check for actual values, that's why there is a helper ANY that will simply attempt to match the
output of the pipeline TYPE.
You also need to implement 2 (ideally 4) tests.

test_small_model_pt : Define 1 small model for this pipeline (doesn't matter if the results don't make sense)
  and test the pipeline outputs.
