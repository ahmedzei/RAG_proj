Create a new file tests/test_pipelines_MY_PIPELINE.py with examples of the other tests.
The run_pipeline_test function will be very generic and run on small random models on every possible
architecture as defined by model_mapping and tf_model_mapping.
This is very important to test future compatibility, meaning if someone adds a new model for
XXXForQuestionAnswering then the pipeline test will attempt to run on it.
