After that, anyone can use it as long as they provide the option
trust_remote_code=True:

from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline(model="{your_username}/test-dynamic-pipeline", trust_remote_code=True)

Add the pipeline to ðŸ¤— Transformers
If you want to contribute your pipeline to ðŸ¤— Transformers, you will need to add a new module in the pipelines submodule
with the code of your pipeline, then add it to the list of tasks defined in pipelines/__init__.py.
