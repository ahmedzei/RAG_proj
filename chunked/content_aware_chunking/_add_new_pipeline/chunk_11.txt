For instance sgugger/finetuned-bert-mrpc has been
fine-tuned on the MRPC dataset, which classifies pairs of sentences as paraphrases or not.

from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("pair-classification", model="sgugger/finetuned-bert-mrpc")

Then we can share it on the Hub by using the save_pretrained method in a Repository:

from huggingface_hub import Repository
repo = Repository("test-dynamic-pipeline", clone_from="{your_username}/test-dynamic-pipeline")
classifier.save_pretrained("test-dynamic-pipeline")
repo.push_to_hub()

This will copy the file where you defined PairClassificationPipeline inside the folder "test-dynamic-pipeline",
along with saving the model and tokenizer of the pipeline, before pushing everything into the repository
{your_username}/test-dynamic-pipeline.
