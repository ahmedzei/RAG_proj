Trainer
The [Trainer] class provides an API for feature-complete training in PyTorch, and it supports distributed training on multiple GPUs/TPUs, mixed precision for NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, and torch.amp for PyTorch. [Trainer] goes hand-in-hand with the [TrainingArguments] class, which offers a wide range of options to customize how a model is trained.
