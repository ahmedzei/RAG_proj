Together, these two classes provide a complete training API.
[Seq2SeqTrainer] and [Seq2SeqTrainingArguments] inherit from the [Trainer] and [TrainingArgument] classes and they're adapted for training models for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as summarization or translation.

The [Trainer] class is optimized for ðŸ¤— Transformers models and can have surprising behaviors
when used with other models.
