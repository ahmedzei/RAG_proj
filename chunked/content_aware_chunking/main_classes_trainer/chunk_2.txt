When using it with your own model, make sure:

your model always return tuples or subclasses of [~utils.ModelOutput]
your model can compute the loss if a labels argument is provided and that loss is returned as the first
  element of the tuple (if your model returns tuples)
your model can accept multiple label arguments (use label_names in [TrainingArguments] to indicate their name to the [Trainer]) but none of them should be named "label"
