The one-liner also includes
handy support for generation prompts, but note that it doesn't add BOS or EOS tokens!
If your model expects those, they won't be added automatically by apply_chat_template - in other words, the
text will be tokenized with add_special_tokens=False. This is to avoid potential conflicts between the template and
the add_special_tokens logic.
