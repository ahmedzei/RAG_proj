Even when
the class template is appropriate for your model, we strongly recommend overriding the default template by
setting the chat_template attribute explicitly to make it clear to users that your model has been correctly configured
for chat, and to future-proof in case the default templates are ever altered or deprecated.
What template should I use?
When setting the template for a model that's already been trained for chat, you should ensure that the template
exactly matches the message formatting that the model saw during training, or else you will probably experience
performance degradation.
