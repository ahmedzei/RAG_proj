This is very analogous to tokenization - you generally get the
best performance for inference or fine-tuning when you precisely match the tokenization used during training.
If you're training a model from scratch, or fine-tuning a base language model for chat, on the other hand,
you have a lot of freedom to choose an appropriate template! LLMs are smart enough to learn to handle lots of different
input formats.
