Some models, like BlenderBot and LLaMA, don't have any
special tokens before bot responses. In these cases, the add_generation_prompt argument will have no effect. The exact

Can I use chat templates in training?
Yes! We recommend that you apply the chat template as a preprocessing step for your dataset. After this, you
can simply continue like any other language model training task.
