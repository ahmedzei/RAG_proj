Mistral-instruct was trained with these tokens, but BlenderBot was not.
How do I use chat templates?
As you can see in the example above, chat templates are easy to use. Simply build a list of messages, with role
and content keys, and then pass it to the [~PreTrainedTokenizer.apply_chat_template] method. Once you do that,
you'll get output that's ready to go! When using chat templates as input for model generation, it's also a good idea
to use add_generation_prompt=True to add a generation prompt.
