The output looks like this:

<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful chatbot that will do its best not to say anything so stupid that people tweet about it.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
How are you?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I'm doing great!<|im_end|>
The "user", "system" and "assistant" roles are the standard for chat, and we recommend using them when it makes sense,
particularly if you want your model to operate well with [TextGenerationPipeline].
