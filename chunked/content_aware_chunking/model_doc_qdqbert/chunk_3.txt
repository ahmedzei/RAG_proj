QDQBERT model can be loaded from any checkpoint of HuggingFace BERT model (for example google-bert/bert-base-uncased), and
  perform Quantization Aware Training/Post Training Quantization.
A complete example of using QDQBERT model to perform Quatization Aware Training and Post Training Quantization for
  SQUAD task can be found at transformers/examples/research_projects/quantization-qdqbert/.

Set default quantizers
QDQBERT model adds fake quantization operations (pair of QuantizeLinear/DequantizeLinear ops) to BERT by
TensorQuantizer in Pytorch Quantization Toolkit.
