Overview
The QDQBERT model can be referenced in Integer Quantization for Deep Learning Inference: Principles and Empirical
Evaluation by Hao Wu, Patrick Judd, Xiaojie Zhang, Mikhail Isaev and Paulius
Micikevicius.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Quantization techniques can reduce the size of Deep Neural Networks and improve inference latency and throughput by
taking advantage of high throughput integer instructions.
