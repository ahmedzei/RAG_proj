These errors depend on how CUDA is installed on your system, and this section focuses on PyTorch built with CUDA 10.2.

For any other installation issues, please open an issue with the DeepSpeed team.

Non-identical CUDA toolkits
PyTorch comes with its own CUDA toolkit, but to use DeepSpeed with PyTorch, you need to have an identical version of CUDA installed system-wide.
