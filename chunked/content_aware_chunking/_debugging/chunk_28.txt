Then you instantiate this class as:
python
debug_overflow = DebugUnderflowOverflow(model, trace_batch_nums=[1, 3])
And now full batches 1 and 3 will be traced using the same format as the underflow/overflow detector does.
Batches are 0-indexed.
This is helpful if you know that the program starts misbehaving after a certain batch number, so you can fast-forward
right to that area.
