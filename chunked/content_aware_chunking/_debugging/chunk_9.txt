To resolve this, you can create a symlink to give the build system visibility to the older compiler.
```bash
adapt the path to your system
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-7  /usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin/gcc
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/g++-7  /usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin/g++

Prebuild
If you're still having issues with installing DeepSpeed or if you're building DeepSpeed at run time, you can try to prebuild the DeepSpeed modules before installing them.
