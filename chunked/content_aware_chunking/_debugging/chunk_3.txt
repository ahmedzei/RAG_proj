When CUDA is correctly setup and added to your PATH environment variable, you can find the installation location with the following command:

which nvcc
Multiple CUDA toolkits
You may also have more than one CUDA toolkit installed system-wide.

/usr/local/cuda-10.2
/usr/local/cuda-11.0
Typically, package installers set the paths to whatever the last version was installed.
