This command prepends rather than overwrites the existing values.
```bash
adjust the version and full path if needed
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

In addition, you should also check the directories you assign actually exist.
