For example, if you installed PyTorch with cudatoolkit==10.2 in your Python environment, then you'll also need to have CUDA 10.2 installed system-wide. If you don't have CUDA installed system-wide, you should install it first.
The exact location may vary from system to system, but usr/local/cuda-10.2 is the most common location on many Unix systems.
