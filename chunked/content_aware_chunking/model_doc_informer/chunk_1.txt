Informer
Overview
The Informer model was proposed in Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting by Haoyi Zhou, Shanghang Zhang, Jieqi Peng, Shuai Zhang, Jianxin Li, Hui Xiong, and Wancai Zhang.
This method introduces a Probabilistic Attention mechanism to select the "active" queries rather than the "lazy" queries and provides a sparse Transformer thus mitigating the quadratic compute and memory requirements of vanilla attention.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning.
