Customize the Trainer
While the [Trainer] class is designed to be accessible and easy-to-use, it also offers a lot of customizability for more adventurous users. Many of the [Trainer]'s method can be subclassed and overridden to support the functionality you want, without having to rewrite the entire training loop from scratch to accommodate it.
