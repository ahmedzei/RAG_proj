But at the same time, [Trainer] is very customizable and offers a ton of training options so you can tailor it to your exact training needs.

In addition to the [Trainer] class, Transformers also provides a [Seq2SeqTrainer] class for sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation or summarization. There is also the [~trl.SFTTrainer] class from the TRL library which wraps the [Trainer] class and is optimized for training language models like Llama-2 and Mistral with autoregressive techniques.
