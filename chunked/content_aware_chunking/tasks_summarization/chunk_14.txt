For this task, load the ROUGE metric (see the ðŸ¤— Evaluate quick tour to learn more about how to load and compute a metric):

import evaluate
rouge = evaluate.load("rouge")

Then create a function that passes your predictions and labels to [~evaluate.EvaluationModule.compute] to calculate the ROUGE metric:

import numpy as np
def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
     predictions, labels = eval_pred
     decoded_preds = tokenizer.batch_decode(predictions, skip_special_tokens=True)
     labels = np.where(labels != -100, labels, tokenizer.pad_token_id)
     decoded_labels = tokenizer.batch_decode(labels, skip_special_tokens=True)

     result = rouge.compute(predictions=decoded_preds, references=decoded_labels, use_stemmer=True)
     prediction_lens = [np.count_nonzero(pred != tokenizer.pad_token_id) for pred in predictions]
     result["gen_len"] = np.mean(prediction_lens)
     return {k: round(v, 4) for k, v in result.items()}

Your compute_metrics function is ready to go now, and you'll return to it when you setup your training.
Train

If you aren't familiar with finetuning a model with the [Trainer], take a look at the basic tutorial here!

You're ready to start training your model now! Load T5 with [AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM]:

from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, Seq2SeqTrainingArguments, Seq2SeqTrainer
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

At this point, only three steps remain:

Define your training hyperparameters in [Seq2SeqTrainingArguments].
