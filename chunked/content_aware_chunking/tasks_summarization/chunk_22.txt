You can also manually replicate the results of the pipeline if you'd like:

Tokenize the text and return the input_ids as PyTorch tensors:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("stevhliu/my_awesome_billsum_model")
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

Use the [~transformers.generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate] method to create the summarization.
