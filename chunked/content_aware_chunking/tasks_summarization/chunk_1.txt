Load BillSum dataset
Start by loading the smaller California state bill subset of the BillSum dataset from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library:

from datasets import load_dataset
billsum = load_dataset("billsum", split="ca_test")

billsum = billsum.train_test_split(test_size=0.2)

Then take a look at an example:

billsum["train"][0]
