Note that Transformers models all have a default task-relevant loss function, so you don't need to specify one unless you want to:

import tensorflow as tf
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)  # No loss argument!

The last two things to setup before you start training is to compute the ROUGE score from the predictions, and provide a way to push your model to the Hub.
