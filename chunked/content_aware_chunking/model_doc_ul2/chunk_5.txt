Usage tips

UL2 is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a mixture of denoising functions as well as fine-tuned on an array of downstream tasks.
UL2 has the same architecture as T5v1.1 but uses the Gated-SiLU activation function instead of Gated-GELU.
The authors release checkpoints of one architecture which can be seen here

 
As UL2 has the same architecture as T5v1.1,  refer to T5's documentation page for API reference, tips, code examples and notebooks.
