Chinese-CLIP
Overview
The Chinese-CLIP model was proposed in Chinese CLIP: Contrastive Vision-Language Pretraining in Chinese by An Yang, Junshu Pan, Junyang Lin, Rui Men, Yichang Zhang, Jingren Zhou, Chang Zhou.
Chinese-CLIP is an implementation of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) on a large-scale dataset of Chinese image-text pairs. It is capable of performing cross-modal retrieval and also playing as a vision backbone for vision tasks like zero-shot image classification, open-domain object detection, etc.
