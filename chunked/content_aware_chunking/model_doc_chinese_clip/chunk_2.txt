We develop 5 Chinese CLIP models of multiple sizes, spanning from 77 to 958 million parameters. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage pretraining method, where the model is first trained with the image encoder frozen and then trained with all parameters being optimized, to achieve enhanced model performance.
