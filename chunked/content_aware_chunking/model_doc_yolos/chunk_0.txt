Overview
The YOLOS model was proposed in You Only Look at One Sequence: Rethinking Transformer in Vision through Object Detection by Yuxin Fang, Bencheng Liao, Xinggang Wang, Jiemin Fang, Jiyang Qi, Rui Wu, Jianwei Niu, Wenyu Liu.
YOLOS proposes to just leverage the plain Vision Transformer (ViT) for object detection, inspired by DETR.
