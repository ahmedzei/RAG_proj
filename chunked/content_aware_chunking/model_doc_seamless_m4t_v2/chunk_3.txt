This newer model, incorporating an updated UnitY2 framework, was trained on more low-resource language data. The expanded version of SeamlessAlign adds 114,800 hours of automatically aligned data for a total of 76 languages. SeamlessM4T v2 provides the foundation on which our two newest models, SeamlessExpressive and SeamlessStreaming, are initiated. SeamlessExpressive enables translation that preserves vocal styles and prosody.
