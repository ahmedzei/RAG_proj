Additionally, for speech output, a vocoder inspired by the HiFi-GAN architecture is placed on top of the second seq2seq model.
Difference with SeamlessM4T-v1
The architecture of this new version differs from the first in a few aspects:
Improvements on the second-pass model
The second seq2seq model, named text-to-unit model, is now non-auto regressive, meaning that it computes units in a single forward pass.
