First, load the processor and a checkpoint of the model:
thon

from transformers import AutoProcessor, SeamlessM4Tv2Model
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/seamless-m4t-v2-large")
model = SeamlessM4Tv2Model.from_pretrained("facebook/seamless-m4t-v2-large")

You can seamlessly use this model on text or on audio, to generated either translated text or translated audio.
