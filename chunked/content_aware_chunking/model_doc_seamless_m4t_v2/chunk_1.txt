For more details on the differences between v1 and v2, refer to section Difference with SeamlessM4T-v1.
SeamlessM4T-v2 enables multiple tasks without relying on separate models:

Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST)
Speech-to-text translation (S2TT)
Text-to-speech translation (T2ST)
Text-to-text translation (T2TT)
Automatic speech recognition (ASR)

[SeamlessM4Tv2Model] can perform all the above tasks, but each task also has its own dedicated sub-model.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Recent advancements in automatic speech translation have dramatically expanded language coverage, improved multimodal capabilities, and enabled a wide range of tasks and functionalities.
