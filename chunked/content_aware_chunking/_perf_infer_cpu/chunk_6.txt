If the forward parameter order does not match the tuple input order in jit.trace, like a text classification model, jit.trace will fail and we are capturing this with the exception here to make it fallback. Logging is used to notify users.

IPEX graph optimization
IntelÂ® Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) provides further optimizations in JIT mode for Intel CPUs, and we recommend combining it with TorchScript for even faster performance.
