GPT-NeoX-Japanese
Overview
We introduce GPT-NeoX-Japanese, which is an autoregressive language model for Japanese, trained on top of https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox.
Japanese is a unique language with its large vocabulary and a combination of hiragana, katakana, and kanji writing scripts.
To address this distinct structure of the Japanese language, we use a special sub-word tokenizer.
