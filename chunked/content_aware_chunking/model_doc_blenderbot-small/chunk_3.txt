We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter models, and make our models
and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn
dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements. We then discuss the limitations of this work by analyzing
failure cases of our models.
