Some lower quality ones may not give the card the stable voltage it needs to function at its peak.
And of course the PSU needs to have enough unused Watts to power the card.
Cooling:
When a GPU gets overheated it will start throttling down and will not deliver full performance and it can even shutdown if it gets too hot.
It's hard to tell the exact best temperature to strive for when a GPU is heavily loaded, but probably anything under +80C is good, but lower is better - perhaps 70-75C is an excellent range to be in.
