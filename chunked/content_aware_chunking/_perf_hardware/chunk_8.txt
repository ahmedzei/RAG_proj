Some of these will make the communication between cards faster (e.g. NVLink), others slower (e.g. PHB).
Depending on the type of scalability solution used, the connectivity speed could have a major or a minor impact. If the GPUs need to sync rarely, as in DDP, the impact of a slower connection will be less significant.
