Speech2Text2 is always used within the SpeechEncoderDecoder framework.
Speech2Text2's tokenizer is based on fastBPE.

Inference
Speech2Text2's [SpeechEncoderDecoderModel] model accepts raw waveform input values from speech and
makes use of [~generation.GenerationMixin.generate] to translate the input speech
autoregressively to the target language.
The [Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor] class is responsible for preprocessing the input speech and
[Speech2Text2Tokenizer] decodes the generated target tokens to the target string.
