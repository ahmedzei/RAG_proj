While effective at reducing self attention's quadratic complexity,
local attention weakens two of the most desirable properties of self attention: long range inter-dependency modeling,
and global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and
efficient extension to NA that can capture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no
additional cost.
