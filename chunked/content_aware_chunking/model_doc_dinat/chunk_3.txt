NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention complement each other, and therefore we
introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon both.
DiNAT variants enjoy significant improvements over strong baselines such as NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt.
Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin counterpart by 1.5% box AP in COCO object detection,
1.3% mask AP in COCO instance segmentation, and 1.1% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation.
Paired with new frameworks, our large variant is the new state of the art panoptic segmentation model on COCO (58.2 PQ)
and ADE20K (48.5 PQ), and instance segmentation model on Cityscapes (44.5 AP) and ADE20K (35.4 AP) (no extra data).
It also matches the state of the art specialized semantic segmentation models on ADE20K (58.2 mIoU),
and ranks second on Cityscapes (84.5 mIoU) (no extra data).
