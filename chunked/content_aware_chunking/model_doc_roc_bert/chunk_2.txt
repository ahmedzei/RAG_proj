The model takes as input multimodal information including the
semantic, phonetic and visual features. We show all these features are important to the model robustness since the
attack can be performed in all the three forms. Across 5 Chinese NLU tasks, ROCBERT outperforms strong baselines under
three blackbox adversarial algorithms without sacrificing the performance on clean testset.
