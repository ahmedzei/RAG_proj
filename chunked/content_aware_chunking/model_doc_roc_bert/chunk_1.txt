However, they have been shown
vulnerable to adversarial attacks especially for logographic languages like Chinese. In this work, we propose
ROCBERT: a pretrained Chinese Bert that is robust to various forms of adversarial attacks like word perturbation,
synonyms, typos, etc. It is pretrained with the contrastive learning objective which maximizes the label consistency
under different synthesized adversarial examples.
