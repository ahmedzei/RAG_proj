If you're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we'll review it! The resource should ideally demonstrate something new instead of duplicating an existing resource.

LayoutLMv3 is nearly identical to LayoutLMv2, so we've also included LayoutLMv2 resources you can adapt for LayoutLMv3 tasks.
