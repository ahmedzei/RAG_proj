LayoutLMv3
Overview
The LayoutLMv3 model was proposed in LayoutLMv3: Pre-training for Document AI with Unified Text and Image Masking by Yupan Huang, Tengchao Lv, Lei Cui, Yutong Lu, Furu Wei.
LayoutLMv3 simplifies LayoutLMv2 by using patch embeddings (as in ViT) instead of leveraging a CNN backbone, and pre-trains the model on 3 objectives: masked language modeling (MLM), masked image modeling (MIM)
and word-patch alignment (WPA).
