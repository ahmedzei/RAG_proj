Despite the
widespread use of pretraining models for NLP applications, they almost exclusively focus on text-level manipulation,
while neglecting layout and style information that is vital for document image understanding. In this paper, we propose
the LayoutLM to jointly model interactions between text and layout information across scanned document images, which is
beneficial for a great number of real-world document image understanding tasks such as information extraction from
scanned documents.
