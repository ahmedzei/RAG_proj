BetterTransformer still has a wider coverage than the Transformers SDPA integration, but you can expect more and more architectures to natively support SDPA in Transformers.

Check out our benchmarks with BetterTransformer and scaled dot product attention in the Out of the box acceleration and memory savings of ðŸ¤— decoder models with PyTorch 2.0 and learn more about the fastpath execution in the BetterTransformer blog post.

BetterTransformer accelerates inference with its fastpath (native PyTorch specialized implementation of Transformer functions) execution.
