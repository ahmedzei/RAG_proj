This section only provides a brief and simple example.

ONNX Runtime (ORT) is a model accelerator that supports accelerated inference on Nvidia GPUs, and AMD GPUs that use ROCm stack. ORT uses optimization techniques like fusing common operations into a single node and constant folding to reduce the number of computations performed and speedup inference.
