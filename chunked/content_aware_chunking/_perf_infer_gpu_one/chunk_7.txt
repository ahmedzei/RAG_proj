This leads to a significant slowdown for batched generations with padding tokens.
To overcome this, you should use FlashAttention-2 without padding tokens in the sequence during training (by packing a dataset or concatenating sequences until reaching the maximum sequence length).
For a single forward pass on tiiuae/falcon-7b with a sequence length of 4096 and various batch sizes without padding tokens, the expected speedup is:

For a single forward pass on meta-llama/Llama-7b-hf with a sequence length of 4096 and various batch sizes without padding tokens, the expected speedup is:

For sequences with padding tokens (generating with padding tokens), you need to unpad/pad the input sequences to correctly compute the attention scores.
