You should also place all inputs on the same device as the model:

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
model_name = "bigscience/bloom-2b5"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model_8bit = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto", load_in_8bit=True)
prompt = "Hello, my llama is cute"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs)
outputs = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)

To load a model in 4-bit for inference with multiple GPUs, you can control how much GPU RAM you want to allocate to each GPU.
