X-MOD
Overview
The X-MOD model was proposed in Lifting the Curse of Multilinguality by Pre-training Modular Transformers by Jonas Pfeiffer, Naman Goyal, Xi Lin, Xian Li, James Cross, Sebastian Riedel, and Mikel Artetxe.
X-MOD extends multilingual masked language models like XLM-R to include language-specific modular components (language adapters) during pre-training.
