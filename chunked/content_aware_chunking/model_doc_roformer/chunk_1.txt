We investigate various methods to encode positional information in
transformer-based language models and propose a novel implementation named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE). The
proposed RoPE encodes absolute positional information with rotation matrix and naturally incorporates explicit relative
position dependency in self-attention formulation.
