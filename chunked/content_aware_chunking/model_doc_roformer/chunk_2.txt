Notably, RoPE comes with valuable properties such as flexibility of
being expand to any sequence lengths, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and
capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. As a result, the enhanced
transformer with rotary position embedding, or RoFormer, achieves superior performance in tasks with long texts. We
release the theoretical analysis along with some preliminary experiment results on Chinese data.
