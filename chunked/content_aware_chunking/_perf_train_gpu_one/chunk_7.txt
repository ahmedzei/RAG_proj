For instance, for fp16 data type a multiple of 8 is recommended, unless 
it's an A100 GPU, in which case use multiples of 64.
For parameters that are small, consider also Dimension Quantization Effects. 
This is where tiling happens and the right multiplier can have a significant speedup.
Gradient Accumulation
The gradient accumulation method aims to calculate gradients in smaller increments instead of computing them for the 
entire batch at once.
