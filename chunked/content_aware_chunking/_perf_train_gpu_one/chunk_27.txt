Optimizer choice
The most common optimizer used to train transformer models is Adam or AdamW (Adam with weight decay). Adam achieves 
good convergence by storing the rolling average of the previous gradients; however, it adds an additional memory 
footprint of the order of the number of model parameters. To remedy this, you can use an alternative optimizer.
