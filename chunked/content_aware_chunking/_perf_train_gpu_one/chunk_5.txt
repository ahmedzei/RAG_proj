All these approaches are still valid in a multi-GPU setup, plus you can leverage additional parallelism 
techniques outlined in the multi-GPU section. 
Batch size choice
To achieve optimal performance, start by identifying the appropriate batch size. It is recommended to use batch sizes and 
input/output neuron counts that are of size 2^N.
