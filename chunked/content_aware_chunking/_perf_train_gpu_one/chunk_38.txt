By default, everything happens in the main process, and it might not be able to read the data from disk fast 
enough, and thus create a bottleneck, leading to GPU under-utilization. Configure the following arguments to reduce the bottleneck:

DataLoader(pin_memory=True, ) - ensures the data gets preloaded into the pinned memory on CPU and typically leads to much faster transfers from CPU to GPU memory.
DataLoader(num_workers=4, ) - spawn several workers to preload data faster.
