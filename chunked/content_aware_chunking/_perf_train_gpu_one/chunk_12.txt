This results in the same effective batch size while making better use of 
the available GPU resources.
For additional information, please refer to batch size and gradient accumulation benchmarks for RTX-3090
and A100.
Gradient Checkpointing
Some large models may still face memory issues even when the batch size is set to 1 and gradient accumulation is used.
