After 
capturing the graph, different backends can be deployed to lower the graph to an optimized engine. 
You can find more details and benchmarks in PyTorch documentation.
torch.compile has a growing list of backends, which can be found in by calling torchdynamo.list_backends(), each of which with its optional dependencies.
Choose which backend to use by specifying it via torch_compile_backend in the [TrainingArguments].
