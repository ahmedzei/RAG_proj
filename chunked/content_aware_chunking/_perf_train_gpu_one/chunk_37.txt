multi_tensor
pytorch-nightly introduced torch.optim._multi_tensor which should significantly speed up the optimizers for situations 
with lots of small feature tensors. It should eventually become the default, but if you want to experiment with it sooner, take a look at this GitHub issue.
Data preloading
One of the important requirements to reach great training speed is the ability to feed the GPU at the maximum speed it 
can handle.
