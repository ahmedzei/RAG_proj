Often it's a multiple of 8, but it can be 
higher depending on the hardware being used and the model's dtype.
For reference, check out NVIDIA's recommendation for input/output neuron counts and 
batch size for 
fully connected layers (which are involved in GEMMs (General Matrix Multiplications)).
Tensor Core Requirements 
define the multiplier based on the dtype and the hardware.
