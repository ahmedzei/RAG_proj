Efficient Software Prebuilds
PyTorch's pip and conda builds come prebuilt with the cuda toolkit 
which is enough to run PyTorch, but it is insufficient if you need to build cuda extensions.
At times, additional efforts may be required to pre-build some components. For instance, if you're using libraries like apex that 
don't come pre-compiled.
