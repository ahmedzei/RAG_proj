The audio streams for each 
channel are combined to give the final stereo output.
Unconditional Generation
The inputs for unconditional (or 'null') generation can be obtained through the method
[MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.get_unconditional_inputs]:
thon

from transformers import MusicgenForConditionalGeneration
model = MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")
unconditional_inputs = model.get_unconditional_inputs(num_samples=1)
audio_values = model.generate(**unconditional_inputs, do_sample=True, max_new_tokens=256)

The audio outputs are a three-dimensional Torch tensor of shape (batch_size, num_channels, sequence_length).
