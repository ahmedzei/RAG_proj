MusicGen
Overview
The MusicGen model was proposed in the paper Simple and Controllable Music Generation
by Jade Copet, Felix Kreuk, Itai Gat, Tal Remez, David Kant, Gabriel Synnaeve, Yossi Adi and Alexandre DÃ©fossez.
MusicGen is a single stage auto-regressive Transformer model capable of generating high-quality music samples conditioned
on text descriptions or audio prompts. The text descriptions are passed through a frozen text encoder model to obtain a
sequence of hidden-state representations.
