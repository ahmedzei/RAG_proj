Higher guidance scale encourages the model to generate samples that are more closely linked to the input
prompt, usually at the expense of poorer audio quality. CFG is enabled by setting guidance_scale > 1. For best results,
use guidance_scale=3 (default).
Audio-Prompted Generation
The same [MusicgenProcessor] can be used to pre-process an audio prompt that is used for audio continuation.
