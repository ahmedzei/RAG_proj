Audio encoder/decoder: used to encode an audio prompt to use as prompt tokens, and recover the audio waveform from the audio tokens predicted by the decoder
Thus, the MusicGen model can either be used as a standalone decoder model, corresponding to the class [MusicgenForCausalLM],
or as a composite model that includes the text encoder and audio encoder/decoder, corresponding to the class
[MusicgenForConditionalGeneration].
