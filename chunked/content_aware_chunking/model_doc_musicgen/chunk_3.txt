Unlike prior work, MusicGen is comprised
of a single-stage transformer LM together with efficient token interleaving patterns, which eliminates the need for
cascading several models, e.g., hierarchically or upsampling. Following this approach, we demonstrate how MusicGen
can generate high-quality samples, while being conditioned on textual description or melodic features, allowing better
controls over the generated output.
