However, in many cases there is labeled data available for related
languages which is not utilized by these methods. This paper extends previous work on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer
learning by fine-tuning a multilingually pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model to transcribe unseen languages. This is done by
mapping phonemes of the training languages to the target language using articulatory features.
