Given a fixed small set of learned object queries,
DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of
predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many
other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and
highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset.
