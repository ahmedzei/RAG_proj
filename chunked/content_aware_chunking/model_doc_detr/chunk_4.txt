Moreover, DETR can be easily
generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive
baselines.

How DETR works
Here's a TLDR explaining how [~transformers.DetrForObjectDetection] works:
First, an image is sent through a pre-trained convolutional backbone (in the paper, the authors use
ResNet-50/ResNet-101). Let's assume we also add a batch dimension.
