For evaluation, one should first convert the
outputs of the model using one of the postprocessing methods of [~transformers.DetrImageProcessor]. These can
be be provided to either CocoEvaluator or PanopticEvaluator, which allow you to calculate metrics like
mean Average Precision (mAP) and Panoptic Quality (PQ). The latter objects are implemented in the original repository.
