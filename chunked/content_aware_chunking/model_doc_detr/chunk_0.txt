DETR
Overview
The DETR model was proposed in End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers by
Nicolas Carion, Francisco Massa, Gabriel Synnaeve, Nicolas Usunier, Alexander Kirillov and Sergey Zagoruyko. DETR
consists of a convolutional backbone followed by an encoder-decoder Transformer which can be trained end-to-end for
object detection.
