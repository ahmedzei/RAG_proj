It greatly simplifies a lot of the complexity of models like Faster-R-CNN and Mask-R-CNN, which use
things like region proposals, non-maximum suppression procedure and anchor generation. Moreover, DETR can also be
naturally extended to perform panoptic segmentation, by simply adding a mask head on top of the decoder outputs.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem.
