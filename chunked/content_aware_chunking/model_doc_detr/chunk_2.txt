Our approach streamlines the
detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression
procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the
new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via
bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture.
