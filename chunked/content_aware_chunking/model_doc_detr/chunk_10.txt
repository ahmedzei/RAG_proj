The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to find
an optimal one-to-one mapping of each of the N queries to each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for
the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the
bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.
DETR can be naturally extended to perform panoptic segmentation (which unifies semantic segmentation and instance
segmentation).
