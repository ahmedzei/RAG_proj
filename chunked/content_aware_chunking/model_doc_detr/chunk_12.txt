Note that predicting boxes is
required for the training to be possible, since the Hungarian matching is computed using distances between boxes.
Usage tips

DETR uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. The number of queries determines the maximum
  number of objects that can be detected in a single image, and is set to 100 by default (see parameter
  num_queries of [~transformers.DetrConfig]).
