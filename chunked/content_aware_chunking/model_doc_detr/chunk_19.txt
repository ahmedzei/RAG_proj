There are three ways to instantiate a DETR model (depending on what you prefer):
Option 1: Instantiate DETR with pre-trained weights for entire model

from transformers import DetrForObjectDetection
model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")

Option 2: Instantiate DETR with randomly initialized weights for Transformer, but pre-trained weights for backbone

from transformers import DetrConfig, DetrForObjectDetection
config = DetrConfig()
model = DetrForObjectDetection(config)
Option 3: Instantiate DETR with randomly initialized weights for backbone + Transformerpy
config = DetrConfig(use_pretrained_backbone=False)
model = DetrForObjectDetection(config)

As a summary, consider the following table:
| Task | Object detection | Instance segmentation | Panoptic segmentation |
|------|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Description | Predicting bounding boxes and class labels around objects in an image | Predicting masks around objects (i.e.
