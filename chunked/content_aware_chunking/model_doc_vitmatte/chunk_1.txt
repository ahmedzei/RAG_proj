ViTMatte
Overview
The ViTMatte model was proposed in Boosting Image Matting with Pretrained Plain Vision Transformers by Jingfeng Yao, Xinggang Wang, Shusheng Yang, Baoyuan Wang.
ViTMatte leverages plain Vision Transformers for the task of image matting, which is the process of accurately estimating the foreground object in images and videos.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Recently, plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance on various computer vision tasks, thanks to their strong modeling capacity and large-scale pretraining.
