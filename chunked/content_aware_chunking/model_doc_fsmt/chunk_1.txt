Following our submission from
last year, our baseline systems are large BPE-based transformer models trained with the Fairseq sequence modeling
toolkit which rely on sampled back-translations. This year we experiment with different bitext data filtering schemes,
as well as with adding filtered back-translated data. We also ensemble and fine-tune our models on domain-specific
data, then decode using noisy channel model reranking.
