From the Yelp Review dataset card, you know there are five labels:

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-cased", num_labels=5)

You will see a warning about some of the pretrained weights not being used and some weights being randomly
initialized. Don't worry, this is completely normal! The pretrained head of the BERT model is discarded, and replaced with a randomly initialized classification head.
