The ðŸ¤— Evaluate library provides a simple accuracy function you can load with the [evaluate.load] (see this quicktour for more information) function:

import numpy as np
import evaluate
metric = evaluate.load("accuracy")

Call [~evaluate.compute] on metric to calculate the accuracy of your predictions.
