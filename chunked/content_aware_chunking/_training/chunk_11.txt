For this tutorial you can start with the default training hyperparameters, but feel free to experiment with these to find your optimal settings.
Specify where to save the checkpoints from your training:

from transformers import TrainingArguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="test_trainer")

Evaluate
[Trainer] does not automatically evaluate model performance during training. You'll need to pass [Trainer] a function to compute and report metrics.
