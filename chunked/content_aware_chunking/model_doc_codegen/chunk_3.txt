Our findings show the emergence of conversational capabilities and the effectiveness of the proposed conversational program synthesis paradigm. In addition, our model CodeGen (with up to 16B parameters trained on TPU-v4) outperforms OpenAI's Codex on the HumanEval benchmark. We make the training library JaxFormer including checkpoints available as open source contribution: this https URL.
