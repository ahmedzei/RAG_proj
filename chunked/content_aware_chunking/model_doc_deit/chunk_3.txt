However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an
expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free
transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision
transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external
data.
