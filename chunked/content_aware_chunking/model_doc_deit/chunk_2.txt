DeiT (data-efficient image transformers) are more
efficiently trained transformers for image classification, requiring far less data and far less computing resources
compared to the original ViT models.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image
classification.
