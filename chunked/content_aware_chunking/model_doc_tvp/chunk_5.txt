Text-visual prompting (TVP), is proposed to enhance TVG. TVP involves integrating specially designed patterns, known as 'prompts', into both the visual (image-based) and textual (word-based) input components of a TVG model. These prompts provide additional spatial-temporal context, improving the model's ability to accurately determine event timings in the video. The approach employs 2D visual inputs in place of 3D ones.
