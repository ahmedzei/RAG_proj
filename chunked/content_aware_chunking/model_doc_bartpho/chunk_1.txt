Our BARTpho uses the "large" architecture and pre-training
scheme of the sequence-to-sequence denoising model BART, thus especially suitable for generative NLP tasks. Experiments
on a downstream task of Vietnamese text summarization show that in both automatic and human evaluations, our BARTpho
outperforms the strong baseline mBART and improves the state-of-the-art. We release BARTpho to facilitate future
research and applications of generative Vietnamese NLP tasks.
