Set trust_remote_code=True to use
a model with custom code:

from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained("sgugger/custom-resnet50d", trust_remote_code=True)

It is also strongly encouraged to pass a commit hash as a revision to make sure the author of the models did not
update the code with some malicious new lines (unless you fully trust the authors of the models).
