Either run in your terminal:

huggingface-cli login
or from a notebook:

from huggingface_hub import notebook_login
notebook_login()

You can then push to your own namespace (or an organization you are a member of) like this:
py
resnet50d.push_to_hub("custom-resnet50d")
On top of the modeling weights and the configuration in json format, this also copied the modeling and
configuration .py files in the folder custom-resnet50d and uploaded the result to the Hub.
