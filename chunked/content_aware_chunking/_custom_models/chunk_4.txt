Writing your model in this 
style results in simpler code with a clear "source of truth" for any hyperparameters, and also makes it easier
to reuse code from other models in transformers.

In our example, we will take a couple of arguments of the ResNet class that we might want to tweak. Different
configurations will then give us the different types of ResNets that are possible.
