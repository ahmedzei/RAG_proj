The line that sets the config_class is not mandatory, unless
you want to register your model with the auto classes (see last section).

If your model is very similar to a model inside the library, you can re-use the same configuration as this model.

You can have your model return anything you want, but returning a dictionary like we did for
ResnetModelForImageClassification, with the loss included when labels are passed, will make your model directly
usable inside the [Trainer] class.
