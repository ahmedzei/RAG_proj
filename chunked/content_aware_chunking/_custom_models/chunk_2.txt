We'll see how to build upon transformers and extend the framework with your hooks and
custom code.
We will illustrate all of this on a ResNet model, by wrapping the ResNet class of the
timm library into a [PreTrainedModel].
Writing a custom configuration
Before we dive into the model, let's first write its configuration. The configuration of a model is an object that
will contain all the necessary information to build the model.
