You can then reload your config with the
from_pretrained method:
py
resnet50d_config = ResnetConfig.from_pretrained("custom-resnet")
You can also use any other method of the [PretrainedConfig] class, like [~PretrainedConfig.push_to_hub] to
directly upload your config to the Hub.
Writing a custom model
Now that we have our ResNet configuration, we can go on writing the model.
