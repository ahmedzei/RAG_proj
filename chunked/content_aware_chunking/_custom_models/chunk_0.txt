Building custom models
The ðŸ¤— Transformers library is designed to be easily extensible. Every model is fully coded in a given subfolder
of the repository with no abstraction, so you can easily copy a modeling file and tweak it to your needs.
If you are writing a brand new model, it might be easier to start from scratch.
