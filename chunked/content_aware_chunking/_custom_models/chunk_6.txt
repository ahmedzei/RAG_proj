When reloading a
config with the from_pretrained method, those fields need to be accepted by your config and then sent to the
superclass.
Defining a model_type for your configuration (here model_type="resnet") is not mandatory, unless you want to
register your model with the auto classes (see last section).
With this done, you can easily create and save your configuration like you would do with any other model config of the
library.
