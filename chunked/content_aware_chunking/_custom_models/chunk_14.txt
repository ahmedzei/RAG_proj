Since our model is just a wrapper around it, it's going to be
easy to transfer those weights:

import timm
pretrained_model = timm.create_model("resnet50d", pretrained=True)
resnet50d.model.load_state_dict(pretrained_model.state_dict())

Now let's see how to make sure that when we do [~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained] or [~PreTrainedModel.push_to_hub], the
code of the model is saved.
Registering a model with custom code to the auto classes
If you are writing a library that extends ðŸ¤— Transformers, you may want to extend the auto classes to include your own
model.
