To share your model with the community, follow those steps: first import the ResNet model and config from the newly
created files:
py
from resnet_model.configuration_resnet import ResnetConfig
from resnet_model.modeling_resnet import ResnetModel, ResnetModelForImageClassification
Then you have to tell the library you want to copy the code files of those objects when using the save_pretrained
method and properly register them with a given Auto class (especially for models), just run:
py
ResnetConfig.register_for_auto_class()
ResnetModel.register_for_auto_class("AutoModel")
ResnetModelForImageClassification.register_for_auto_class("AutoModelForImageClassification")
Note that there is no need to specify an auto class for the configuration (there is only one auto class for them,
[AutoConfig]) but it's different for models.
