We focus on wav2vec 2.0, and formalize several architecture designs that influence both the model performance
and its efficiency. Putting together all our observations, we introduce SEW (Squeezed and Efficient Wav2vec), a
pre-trained model architecture with significant improvements along both performance and efficiency dimensions across a
variety of training setups.
