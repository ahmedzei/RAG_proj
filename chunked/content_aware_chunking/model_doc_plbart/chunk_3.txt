Moreover, experiments on discriminative tasks, e.g., program
repair, clone detection, and vulnerable code detection, demonstrate PLBART's effectiveness in program understanding.
Furthermore, analysis reveals that PLBART learns program syntax, style (e.g., identifier naming convention), logical flow
(e.g., if block inside an else block is equivalent to else if block) that are crucial to program semantics and thus excels
even with limited annotations.
