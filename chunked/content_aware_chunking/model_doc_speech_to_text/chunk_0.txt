Speech2Text
Overview
The Speech2Text model was proposed in fairseq S2T: Fast Speech-to-Text Modeling with fairseq by Changhan Wang, Yun Tang, Xutai Ma, Anne Wu, Dmytro Okhonko, Juan Pino. It's a
transformer-based seq2seq (encoder-decoder) model designed for end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech
Translation (ST). It uses a convolutional downsampler to reduce the length of speech inputs by 3/4th before they are
fed into the encoder.
