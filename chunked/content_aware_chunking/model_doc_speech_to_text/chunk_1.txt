The model is trained with standard autoregressive cross-entropy loss and generates the
transcripts/translations autoregressively. Speech2Text has been fine-tuned on several datasets for ASR and ST:
LibriSpeech, CoVoST 2, MuST-C.
This model was contributed by valhalla. The original code can be found here.
