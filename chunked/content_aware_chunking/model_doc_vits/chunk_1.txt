It is a conditional variational 
autoencoder (VAE) comprised of a posterior encoder, decoder, and conditional prior.
A set of spectrogram-based acoustic features are predicted by the flow-based module, which is formed of a Transformer-based
text encoder and multiple coupling layers. The spectrogram is decoded using a stack of transposed convolutional layers,
much in the same style as the HiFi-GAN vocoder.
