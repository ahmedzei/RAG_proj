Usage examples
Both the VITS and MMS-TTS checkpoints can be used with the same API. Since the flow-based model is non-deterministic, it 
is good practice to set a seed to ensure reproducibility of the outputs. For languages with a Roman alphabet, 
such as English or French, the tokenizer can be used directly to pre-process the text inputs.
