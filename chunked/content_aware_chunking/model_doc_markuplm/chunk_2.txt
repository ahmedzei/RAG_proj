While, there are still a
large number of digital documents where the layout information is not fixed and needs to be interactively and
dynamically rendered for visualization, making existing layout-based pre-training approaches not easy to apply. In this
paper, we propose MarkupLM for document understanding tasks with markup languages as the backbone such as
HTML/XML-based documents, where text and markup information is jointly pre-trained.
