Usage: MarkupLMProcessor
The easiest way to prepare data for the model is to use [MarkupLMProcessor], which internally combines a feature extractor
([MarkupLMFeatureExtractor]) and a tokenizer ([MarkupLMTokenizer] or [MarkupLMTokenizerFast]). The feature extractor is
used to extract all nodes and xpaths from the HTML strings, which are then provided to the tokenizer, which turns them into the
token-level inputs of the model (input_ids etc.).
