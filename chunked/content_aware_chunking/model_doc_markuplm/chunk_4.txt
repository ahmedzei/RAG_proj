Usage tips

In addition to input_ids, [~MarkupLMModel.forward] expects 2 additional inputs, namely xpath_tags_seq and xpath_subs_seq.
These are the XPATH tags and subscripts respectively for each token in the input sequence.
One can use [MarkupLMProcessor] to prepare all data for the model. Refer to the usage guide for more info.
