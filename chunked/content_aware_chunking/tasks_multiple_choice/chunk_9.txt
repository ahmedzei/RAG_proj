Note that Transformers models all have a default task-relevant loss function, so you don't need to specify one unless you want to:

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)  # No loss argument!

The last two things to setup before you start training is to compute the accuracy from the predictions, and provide a way to push your model to the Hub.
