For this task, load the accuracy metric (see the ðŸ¤— Evaluate quick tour to learn more about how to load and compute a metric):

import evaluate
accuracy = evaluate.load("accuracy")

Then create a function that passes your predictions and labels to [~evaluate.EvaluationModule.compute] to calculate the accuracy:

import numpy as np
def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
     predictions, labels = eval_pred
     predictions = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
     return accuracy.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)

Your compute_metrics function is ready to go now, and you'll return to it when you setup your training.

If you aren't familiar with finetuning a model with the [Trainer], take a look at the basic tutorial here!

You're ready to start training your model now! Load BERT with [AutoModelForMultipleChoice]:

from transformers import AutoModelForMultipleChoice, TrainingArguments, Trainer
model = AutoModelForMultipleChoice.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-uncased")

At this point, only three steps remain:

Define your training hyperparameters in [TrainingArguments].
