This model was deprecated due to security issues linked to pickle.load.
We recommend switching to more recent models for improved security.
In case you would still like to use TransfoXL in your experiments, we recommend using the Hub checkpoint with a specific revision to ensure you are downloading safe files from the Hub.
You will need to set the environment variable TRUST_REMOTE_CODE to True in order to allow the
usage of pickle.load():
thon
import os
from transformers import TransfoXLTokenizer, TransfoXLLMHeadModel
os.environ["TRUST_REMOTE_CODE"] = "True"
checkpoint = 'transfo-xl/transfo-xl-wt103'
revision = '40a186da79458c9f9de846edfaea79c412137f97'
tokenizer = TransfoXLTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint, revision=revision)
model = TransfoXLLMHeadModel.from_pretrained(checkpoint, revision=revision)

If you run into any issues running this model, please reinstall the last version that supported this model: v4.35.0.
You can do so by running the following command: pip install -U transformers==4.35.0.

Overview
The Transformer-XL model was proposed in Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context by Zihang Dai, Zhilin Yang, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Quoc V.
