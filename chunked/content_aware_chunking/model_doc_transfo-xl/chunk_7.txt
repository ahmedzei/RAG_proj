In this context, a segment is a number of consecutive tokens (for instance 512) that may span across multiple documents, and segments are fed in order to the model.
Basically, the hidden states of the previous segment are concatenated to the current input to compute the attention scores. This allows the model to pay attention to information that was in the previous segment as well as the current one.
