We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency
beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a
novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the
context fragmentation problem.
