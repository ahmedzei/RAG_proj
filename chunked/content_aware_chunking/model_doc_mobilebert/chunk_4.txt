Empirical studies show that MobileBERT is
4.3x smaller and 5.5x faster than BERT_BASE while achieving competitive results on well-known benchmarks. On the
natural language inference tasks of GLUE, MobileBERT achieves a GLUEscore o 77.7 (0.6 lower than BERT_BASE), and 62 ms
latency on a Pixel 4 phone. On the SQuAD v1.1/v2.0 question answering task, MobileBERT achieves a dev F1 score of
90.0/79.2 (1.5/2.1 higher than BERT_BASE).
