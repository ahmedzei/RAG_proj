Basically, MobileBERT is a thin version of BERT_LARGE, while
equipped with bottleneck structures and a carefully designed balance between self-attentions and feed-forward networks.
To train MobileBERT, we first train a specially designed teacher model, an inverted-bottleneck incorporated BERT_LARGE
model. Then, we conduct knowledge transfer from this teacher to MobileBERT.
