For the first time, we show that a single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks across four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces, and natural images.

Tips:
Pix2Struct has been fine tuned on a variety of tasks and datasets, ranging from image captioning, visual question answering (VQA) over different inputs (books, charts, science diagrams), captioning UI components etc.
