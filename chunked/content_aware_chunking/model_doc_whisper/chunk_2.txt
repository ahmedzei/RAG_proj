Usage tips

The model usually performs well without requiring any finetuning.
The architecture follows a classic encoder-decoder architecture, which means that it relies on the [~generation.GenerationMixin.generate] function for inference.

One can use [WhisperProcessor] to prepare audio for the model, and decode the predicted ID's back into text.

To convert the model and the processor, we recommend using the following:

python src/transformers/models/whisper/convert_openai_to_hf.py --checkpoint_path "" --pytorch_dump_folder_path "Arthur/whisper-3" --convert_preprocessor True
The script will automatically determine all necessary parameters from the OpenAI checkpoint.
