It is capable of handling input sequences of a length up to 16,384 tokens.
For Local Attention, the sparse sliding-window local attention operation allows a given token to attend only r
tokens to the left and right of it (with r=127 by default). Local Attention does not introduce any new parameters
to the model. The complexity of the mechanism is linear in input sequence length l: O(l*r).
Transient Global Attention is an extension of the Local Attention.
