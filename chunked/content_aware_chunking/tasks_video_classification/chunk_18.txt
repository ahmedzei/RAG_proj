To instantiate a Trainer, you need to define the training configuration and an evaluation metric. The most important is the TrainingArguments, which is a class that contains all the attributes to configure the training. It requires an output folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model. It also helps sync all the information in the model repository on ðŸ¤— Hub.
Most of the training arguments are self-explanatory, but one that is quite important here is remove_unused_columns=False.
