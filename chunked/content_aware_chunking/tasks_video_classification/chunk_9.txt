This is expected in this case, because we are adding a new head for which we don't have pretrained weights, so the library warns us we should fine-tune this model before using it for inference, which is exactly what we are going to do.
Note that this checkpoint leads to better performance on this task as the checkpoint was obtained fine-tuning on a similar downstream task having considerable domain overlap.
