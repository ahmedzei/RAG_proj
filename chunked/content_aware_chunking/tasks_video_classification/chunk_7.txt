initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing VideoMAEForVideoClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of VideoMAEForVideoClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at MCG-NJU/videomae-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
The warning is telling us we are throwing away some weights (e.g.
