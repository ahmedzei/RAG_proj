Now fine-tune our model by calling the train method:
 

train_results = trainer.train()

Once training is completed, share your model to the Hub with the [~transformers.Trainer.push_to_hub] method so everyone can use your model:

trainer.push_to_hub()

Inference
Great, now that you have fine-tuned a model, you can use it for inference!
