Zero-shot object detection
[[open-in-colab]]
Traditionally, models used for object detection require labeled image datasets for training,
and are limited to detecting the set of classes from the training data.
Zero-shot object detection is supported by the OWL-ViT model which uses a different approach. OWL-ViT
is an open-vocabulary object detector.
