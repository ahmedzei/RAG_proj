images = [image, im]
text_queries = [
     ["human face", "rocket", "nasa badge", "star-spangled banner"],

inputs = processor(text=text_queries, images=images, return_tensors="pt")

Previously for post-processing you passed the single image's size as a tensor, but you can also pass a tuple, or, in case
of several images, a list of tuples.
