Let's take an image with two cats on a couch as a target image, and an image of a single cat
as a query:

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image_target = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)
query_url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000524280.jpg"
query_image = Image.open(requests.get(query_url, stream=True).raw)

Let's take a quick look at the images:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2)
ax[0].imshow(image_target)
ax[1].imshow(query_image)

In the preprocessing step, instead of text queries, you now need to use query_images:

inputs = processor(images=image_target, query_images=query_image, return_tensors="pt")

For predictions, instead of passing the inputs to the model, pass them to [~OwlViTForObjectDetection.image_guided_detection].
