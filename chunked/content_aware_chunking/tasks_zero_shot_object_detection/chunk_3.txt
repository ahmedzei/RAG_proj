The authors
of OWL-ViT first trained CLIP from scratch and then fine-tuned OWL-ViT end to end on standard object detection datasets using
a bipartite matching loss.
With this approach, the model can detect objects based on textual descriptions without prior training on labeled datasets.
In this guide, you will learn how to use OWL-ViT:
- to detect objects based on text prompts
- for batch object detection
- for image-guided object detection
Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:

pip install -q transformers
Zero-shot object detection pipeline
The simplest way to try out inference with OWL-ViT is to use it in a [pipeline].
