Here we'll use the image of astronaut Eileen Collins that is
a part of the NASA Great Images dataset.

import skimage
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
image = skimage.data.astronaut()
image = Image.fromarray(np.uint8(image)).convert("RGB")
image

Pass the image and the candidate object labels to look for to the pipeline.
Here we pass the image directly; other suitable options include a local path to an image or an image url.
