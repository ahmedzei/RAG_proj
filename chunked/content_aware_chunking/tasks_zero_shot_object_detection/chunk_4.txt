Instantiate a pipeline
for zero-shot object detection from a checkpoint on the Hugging Face Hub:
thon

from transformers import pipeline
checkpoint = "google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble"
detector = pipeline(model=checkpoint, task="zero-shot-object-detection")

Next, choose an image you'd like to detect objects in.
