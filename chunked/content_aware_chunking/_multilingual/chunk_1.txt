The nine remaining model checkpoints can be split into two categories: the checkpoints that use language embeddings and those that don't.
XLM with language embeddings
The following XLM models use language embeddings to specify the language used at inference:

FacebookAI/xlm-mlm-ende-1024 (Masked language modeling, English-German)
FacebookAI/xlm-mlm-enfr-1024 (Masked language modeling, English-French)
FacebookAI/xlm-mlm-enro-1024 (Masked language modeling, English-Romanian)
FacebookAI/xlm-mlm-xnli15-1024 (Masked language modeling, XNLI languages)
FacebookAI/xlm-mlm-tlm-xnli15-1024 (Masked language modeling + translation, XNLI languages)
FacebookAI/xlm-clm-enfr-1024 (Causal language modeling, English-French)
FacebookAI/xlm-clm-ende-1024 (Causal language modeling, English-German)

Language embeddings are represented as a tensor of the same shape as the input_ids passed to the model.
