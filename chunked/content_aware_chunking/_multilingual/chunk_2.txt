The values in these tensors depend on the language used and are identified by the tokenizer's lang2id and id2lang attributes.
In this example, load the FacebookAI/xlm-clm-enfr-1024 checkpoint (Causal language modeling, English-French):

import torch
from transformers import XLMTokenizer, XLMWithLMHeadModel
tokenizer = XLMTokenizer.from_pretrained("FacebookAI/xlm-clm-enfr-1024")
model = XLMWithLMHeadModel.from_pretrained("FacebookAI/xlm-clm-enfr-1024")

The lang2id attribute of the tokenizer displays this model's languages and their ids:

print(tokenizer.lang2id)
{'en': 0, 'fr': 1}

Next, create an example input:

input_ids = torch.tensor([tokenizer.encode("Wikipedia was used to")])  # batch size of 1

Set the language id as "en" and use it to define the language embedding.
