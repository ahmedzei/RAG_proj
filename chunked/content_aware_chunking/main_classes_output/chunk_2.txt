Here we have the loss since we passed along labels, but we don't have
hidden_states and attentions because we didn't pass output_hidden_states=True or
output_attentions=True.

When passing output_hidden_states=True you may expect the outputs.hidden_states[-1] to match outputs.last_hidden_states exactly.
However, this is not always the case.
