Here for instance outputs.loss is the loss computed by the model, and outputs.attentions is
None.
When considering our outputs object as tuple, it only considers the attributes that don't have None values.
Here for instance, it has two elements, loss then logits, so
python
outputs[:2]
will return the tuple (outputs.loss, outputs.logits) for instance.
When considering our outputs object as dictionary, it only considers the attributes that don't have None
values.
