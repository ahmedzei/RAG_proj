We measure the
performance of CamemBERT compared to multilingual models in multiple downstream tasks, namely part-of-speech tagging,
dependency parsing, named-entity recognition, and natural language inference. CamemBERT improves the state of the art
for most of the tasks considered. We release the pretrained model for CamemBERT hoping to foster research and
downstream applications for French NLP.
This model was contributed by the ALMAnaCH team (Inria).
