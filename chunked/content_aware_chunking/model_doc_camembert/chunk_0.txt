The CamemBERT model was proposed in CamemBERT: a Tasty French Language Model by
Louis Martin, Benjamin Muller, Pedro Javier Ortiz Suárez, Yoann Dupont, Laurent Romary, Éric Villemonte de la
Clergerie, Djamé Seddah, and Benoît Sagot. It is based on Facebook's RoBERTa model released in 2019. It is a model
