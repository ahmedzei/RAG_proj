However, the most frequent symbol pair is "u" followed by
"g", occurring 10 + 5 + 5 = 20 times in total. Thus, the first merge rule the tokenizer learns is to group all
"u" symbols followed by a "g" symbol together. Next, "ug" is added to the vocabulary. The set of words then
becomes
("h" "ug", 10), ("p" "ug", 5), ("p" "u" "n", 12), ("b" "u" "n", 4), ("h" "ug" "s", 5)
BPE then identifies the next most common symbol pair. It's "u" followed by "n", which occurs 16 times.
