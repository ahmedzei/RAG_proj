"u", followed by "g" would have only been
merged if the probability of "ug" divided by "u", "g" would have been greater than for any other symbol
pair. Intuitively, WordPiece is slightly different to BPE in that it evaluates what it loses by merging two symbols
to ensure it's worth it.

Unigram
Unigram is a subword tokenization algorithm introduced in Subword Regularization: Improving Neural Network Translation
Models with Multiple Subword Candidates (Kudo, 2018).
