Again the pair is merged and "hug" can be added to the vocabulary.
At this stage, the vocabulary is ["b", "g", "h", "n", "p", "s", "u", "ug", "un", "hug"] and our set of unique words
is represented as
("hug", 10), ("p" "ug", 5), ("p" "un", 12), ("b" "un", 4), ("hug" "s", 5)
Assuming, that the Byte-Pair Encoding training would stop at this point, the learned merge rules would then be applied
to new words (as long as those new words do not include symbols that were not in the base vocabulary).
