Assuming that the training data consists of
the words \(x_{1}, \dots, x_{N}\) and that the set of all possible tokenizations for a word \(x_{i}\) is
defined as \(S(x_{i})\), then the overall loss is defined as
$$\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \log \left ( \sum_{x \in S(x_{i})} p(x) \right )$$

SentencePiece
All tokenization algorithms described so far have the same problem: It is assumed that the input text uses spaces to
separate words. However, not all languages use spaces to separate words.
