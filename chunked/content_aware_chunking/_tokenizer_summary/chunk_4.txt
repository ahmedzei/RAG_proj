"Don't" stands for
"do not", so it would be better tokenized as ["Do", "n't"]. This is where things start getting complicated, and
part of the reason each model has its own tokenizer type. Depending on the rules we apply for tokenizing a text, a
different tokenized output is generated for the same text. A pretrained model only performs properly if you feed it an
input that was tokenized with the same rules that were used to tokenize its training data.
spaCy and Moses are two popular
rule-based tokenizers.
