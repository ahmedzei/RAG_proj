For instance, if we look at [BertTokenizer], we can see
that the model uses WordPiece.
Introduction
Splitting a text into smaller chunks is a task that is harder than it looks, and there are multiple ways of doing so.
For instance, let's look at the sentence "Don't you love ðŸ¤— Transformers? We sure do."

A simple way of tokenizing this text is to split it by spaces, which would give:
["Don't", "you", "love", "ðŸ¤—", "Transformers?", "We", "sure", "do."]
This is a sensible first step, but if we look at the tokens "Transformers?" and "do.", we notice that the
punctuation is attached to the words "Transformer" and "do", which is suboptimal.
