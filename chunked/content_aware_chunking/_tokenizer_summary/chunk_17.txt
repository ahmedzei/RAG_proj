XLM,
FlauBERT which uses Moses for most languages, or GPT which uses
spaCy and ftfy, to count the frequency of each word in the training corpus.
After pre-tokenization, a set of unique words has been created and the frequency with which each word occurred in the
training data has been determined. Next, BPE creates a base vocabulary consisting of all symbols that occur in the set
of unique words and learns merge rules to form a new symbol from two symbols of the base vocabulary.
