"##" means that the rest of the token should
be attached to the previous one, without space (for decoding or reversal of the tokenization).
As another example, [~transformers.XLNetTokenizer] tokenizes our previously exemplary text as follows:

from transformers import XLNetTokenizer
tokenizer = XLNetTokenizer.from_pretrained("xlnet/xlnet-base-cased")
tokenizer.tokenize("Don't you love 🤗 Transformers? We sure do.")
["▁Don", "'", "t", "▁you", "▁love", "▁", "🤗", "▁", "Transform", "ers", "?", "▁We", "▁sure", "▁do", "."]

We'll get back to the meaning of those "▁" when we look at SentencePiece.
