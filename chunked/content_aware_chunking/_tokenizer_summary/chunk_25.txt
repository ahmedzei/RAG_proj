To have a better base vocabulary, GPT-2 uses bytes
as the base vocabulary, which is a clever trick to force the base vocabulary to be of size 256 while ensuring that
every base character is included in the vocabulary. With some additional rules to deal with punctuation, the GPT2's
tokenizer can tokenize every text without the need for the  symbol.
