Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains,
such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text.
To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \bold{S}hifted
\bold{win}dows.
