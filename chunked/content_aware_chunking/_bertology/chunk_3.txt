In order to help this new field develop, we have included a few additional features in the BERT/GPT/GPT-2 models to
help people access the inner representations, mainly adapted from the great work of Paul Michel
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10650):

accessing all the hidden-states of BERT/GPT/GPT-2,
accessing all the attention weights for each head of BERT/GPT/GPT-2,
retrieving heads output values and gradients to be able to compute head importance score and prune head as explained
  in https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10650.
