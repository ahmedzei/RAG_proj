While most state-of-the-art image restoration methods are based on convolutional neural networks, other transformers-based methods such as SwinIR, show impressive performance on these tasks.
In this paper, we explore the novel Swin Transformer V2, to improve SwinIR for image super-resolution, and in particular, the compressed input scenario.
