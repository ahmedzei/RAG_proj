You'll push this model to the Hub by setting push_to_hub=True (you need to be signed in to Hugging Face to upload your model).
Pass the training arguments to [Trainer] along with the model, dataset, tokenizer, and data collator.
Call [~Trainer.train] to finetune your model.

training_args = TrainingArguments(
     output_dir="my_awesome_qa_model",
     evaluation_strategy="epoch",
     learning_rate=2e-5,
     per_device_train_batch_size=16,
     per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
     num_train_epochs=3,
     weight_decay=0.01,
     push_to_hub=True,
 )
trainer = Trainer(
     model=model,
     args=training_args,
     train_dataset=tokenized_squad["train"],
     eval_dataset=tokenized_squad["test"],
     tokenizer=tokenizer,
     data_collator=data_collator,
 )
trainer.train()

Once training is completed, share your model to the Hub with the [~transformers.Trainer.push_to_hub] method so everyone can use your model:

trainer.push_to_hub()

If you aren't familiar with finetuning a model with Keras, take a look at the basic tutorial here!

To finetune a model in TensorFlow, start by setting up an optimizer function, learning rate schedule, and some training hyperparameters:

from transformers import create_optimizer
batch_size = 16
num_epochs = 2
total_train_steps = (len(tokenized_squad["train"]) // batch_size) * num_epochs
optimizer, schedule = create_optimizer(
     init_lr=2e-5,
     num_warmup_steps=0,
     num_train_steps=total_train_steps,
 )

Then you can load DistilBERT with [TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering]:

from transformers import TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering
model = TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")

Convert your datasets to the tf.data.Dataset format with [~transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.prepare_tf_dataset]:

tf_train_set = model.prepare_tf_dataset(
     tokenized_squad["train"],
     shuffle=True,
     batch_size=16,
     collate_fn=data_collator,
 )
tf_validation_set = model.prepare_tf_dataset(
     tokenized_squad["test"],
     shuffle=False,
     batch_size=16,
     collate_fn=data_collator,
 )

Configure the model for training with compile:

import tensorflow as tf
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)

The last thing to setup before you start training is to provide a way to push your model to the Hub.
