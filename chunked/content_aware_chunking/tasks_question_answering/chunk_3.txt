There are several important fields here:

answers: the starting location of the answer token and the answer text.
context: background information from which the model needs to extract the answer.
question: the question a model should answer.

Preprocess

The next step is to load a DistilBERT tokenizer to process the question and context fields:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")

There are a few preprocessing steps particular to question answering tasks you should be aware of:

Some examples in a dataset may have a very long context that exceeds the maximum input length of the model.
