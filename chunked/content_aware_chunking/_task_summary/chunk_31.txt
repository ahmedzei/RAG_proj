In the early days, translation models were mostly monolingual, but recently, there has been increasing interest in multilingual models that can translate between many pairs of languages.

from transformers import pipeline
text = "translate English to French: Hugging Face is a community-based open-source platform for machine learning."
translator = pipeline(task="translation", model="google-t5/t5-small")
translator(text)
[{'translation_text': "Hugging Face est une tribune communautaire de l'apprentissage des machines."}]
