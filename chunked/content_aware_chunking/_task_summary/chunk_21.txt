There are many practical applications for text classification, some of which include:

sentiment analysis: label text according to some polarity like positive or negative which can inform and support decision-making in fields like politics, finance, and marketing
content classification: label text according to some topic to help organize and filter information in news and social media feeds (weather, sports, finance, etc.)

from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline(task="sentiment-analysis")
preds = classifier("Hugging Face is the best thing since sliced bread!")
preds = [{"score": round(pred["score"], 4), "label": pred["label"]} for pred in preds]
preds
[{'score': 0.9991, 'label': 'POSITIVE'}]

Token classification
In any NLP task, text is preprocessed by separating the sequence of text into individual words or subwords.
