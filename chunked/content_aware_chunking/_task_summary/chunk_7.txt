By pretraining on large amounts of speech data, finetuning the model on only one hour of labeled speech data in a low-resource language can still produce high-quality results compared to previous ASR systems trained on 100x more labeled data.

One of the first and earliest successful computer vision tasks was recognizing images of zip code numbers using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
