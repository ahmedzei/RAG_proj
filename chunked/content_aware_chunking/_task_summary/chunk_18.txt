Depth information is also helpful for constructing 3D representations from 2D images and can be used to create high-quality 3D representations of biological structures or buildings.
There are two approaches to depth estimation:

stereo: depths are estimated by comparing two images of the same image from slightly different angles
monocular: depths are estimated from a single image

from transformers import pipeline
depth_estimator = pipeline(task="depth-estimation")
preds = depth_estimator(

Natural language processing
NLP tasks are among the most common types of tasks because text is such a natural way for us to communicate.
