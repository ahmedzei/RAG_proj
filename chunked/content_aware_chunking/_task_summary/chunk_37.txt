In the example below, the total amount and change due can be extracted from a receipt.

from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image
import requests
url = "https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/assets/hf-internal-testing/example-documents/--/hf-internal-testing--example-documents/test/2/image/image.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)
doc_question_answerer = pipeline("document-question-answering", model="magorshunov/layoutlm-invoices")
preds = doc_question_answerer(
     question="What is the total amount?",
     image=image,
 )
preds
[{'score': 0.8531, 'answer': '17,000', 'start': 4, 'end': 4}]
