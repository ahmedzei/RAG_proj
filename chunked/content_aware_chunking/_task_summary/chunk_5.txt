It is a broad category with many specific applications, some of which include:

acoustic scene classification: label audio with a scene label ("office", "beach", "stadium")
acoustic event detection: label audio with a sound event label ("car horn", "whale calling", "glass breaking")
tagging: label audio containing multiple sounds (birdsongs, speaker identification in a meeting)
music classification: label music with a genre label ("metal", "hip-hop", "country")

Automatic speech recognition
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcribes speech into text.
