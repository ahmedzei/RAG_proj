These are known as tokens. Token classification assigns each token a label from a predefined set of classes. 
Two common types of token classification are:

named entity recognition (NER): label a token according to an entity category like organization, person, location or date. NER is especially popular in biomedical settings, where it can label genes, proteins, and drug names.
part-of-speech tagging (POS): label a token according to its part-of-speech like noun, verb, or adjective.
