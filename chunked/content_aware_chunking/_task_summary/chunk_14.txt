There are several types of image segmentation:

instance segmentation: in addition to labeling the class of an object, it also labels each distinct instance of an object ("dog-1", "dog-2")
panoptic segmentation: a combination of semantic and instance segmentation; it labels each pixel with a semantic class and each distinct instance of an object

Segmentation tasks are helpful in self-driving vehicles to create a pixel-level map of the world around them so they can navigate safely around pedestrians and other vehicles.
