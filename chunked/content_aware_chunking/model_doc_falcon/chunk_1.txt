Both 'base' models trained only as causal language models as well as
'instruct' models that have received further fine-tuning are available.
Falcon models are (as of 2023) some of the largest and most powerful open-source language models,
and consistently rank highly in the OpenLLM leaderboard.

Falcon models were initially added to the Hugging Face Hub as custom code checkpoints. However, Falcon is now fully
supported in the Transformers library.
