Falcon
Overview
Falcon is a class of causal decoder-only models built by TII. The largest Falcon checkpoints
have been trained on >=1T tokens of text, with a particular emphasis on the RefinedWeb
corpus. They are made available under the Apache 2.0 license.
Falcon's architecture is modern and optimized for inference, with multi-query attention and support for efficient
attention variants like FlashAttention.
