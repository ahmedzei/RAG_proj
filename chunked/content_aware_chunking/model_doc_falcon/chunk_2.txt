If you fine-tuned a model from a custom code checkpoint, we recommend converting
your checkpoint to the new in-library format, as this should give significant improvements to stability and
performance, especially for generation, as well as removing the need to use trust_remote_code=True!

You can convert custom code checkpoints to full Transformers checkpoints using the convert_custom_code_checkpoint.py 
script located in the
Falcon model directory
of the Transformers library.
