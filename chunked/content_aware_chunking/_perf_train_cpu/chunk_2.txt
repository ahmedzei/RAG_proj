However, CPUs with only AVX2 (e.g., AMD or older Intel CPUs) are not guaranteed to have better performance under IPEX.
Auto Mixed Precision (AMP) for CPU backends has been enabled since PyTorch 1.10. AMP support for bf16 on CPUs and bf16 operator optimization is also supported in IPEX and partially upstreamed to the main PyTorch branch.
