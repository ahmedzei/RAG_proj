Modern CPUs such as 3rd and 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors natively support bf16, so you should get more performance out of the box by enabling mixed precision training with bf16.
To further maximize training performance, you can use Intel® Extension for PyTorch (IPEX), which is a library built on PyTorch and adds additional CPU instruction level architecture (ISA) level support such as Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (Intel® AVX512-VNNI), and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX) for an extra performance boost on Intel CPUs.
