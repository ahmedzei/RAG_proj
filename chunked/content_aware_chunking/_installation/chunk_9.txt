For example, if your Python packages are typically installed in ~/anaconda3/envs/main/lib/python3.7/site-packages/, Python will also search the folder you cloned to: ~/transformers/.

You must keep the transformers folder if you want to keep using the library.

Now you can easily update your clone to the latest version of ðŸ¤— Transformers with the following command:

cd ~/transformers/
git pull
Your Python environment will find the main version of ðŸ¤— Transformers on the next run.
