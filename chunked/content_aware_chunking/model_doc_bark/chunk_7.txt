torch.float16), since it results in almost no degradation to audio quality but significantly lower memory usage and faster inference:
python
model = BarkModel.from_pretrained("suno/bark-small", torch_dtype=torch.float16, attn_implementation="flash_attention_2").to(device)
Performance comparison
The following diagram shows the latency for the native attention implementation (no optimisation) against Better Transformer and Flash Attention 2.
