In all cases, we generate 400 semantic tokens on a 40GB A100 GPU with PyTorch 2.1. Flash Attention 2 is also consistently faster than Better Transformer, and its performance improves even more as batch sizes increase:

To put this into perspective, on an NVIDIA A100 and when generating 400 semantic tokens with a batch size of 16, you can get 17 times the throughput and still be 2 seconds faster than generating sentences one by one with the native model implementation.
