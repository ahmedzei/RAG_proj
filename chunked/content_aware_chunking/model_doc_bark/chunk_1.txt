Bark
Overview
Bark is a transformer-based text-to-speech model proposed by Suno AI in suno-ai/bark.
Bark is made of 4 main models:

[BarkSemanticModel] (also referred to as the 'text' model): a causal auto-regressive transformer model that takes as input tokenized text, and predicts semantic text tokens that capture the meaning of the text.
[BarkCoarseModel] (also referred to as the 'coarse acoustics' model): a causal autoregressive transformer, that takes as input the results of the [BarkSemanticModel] model.
