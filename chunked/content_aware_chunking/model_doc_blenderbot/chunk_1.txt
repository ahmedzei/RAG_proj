scaling neural models in the number of parameters and the size of the data they are trained on gives improved results,

skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to
their partners, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, while maintaining a consistent
persona.
