It is instantiated as any other
pipeline but can provide additional quality of life.
Simple call on one item:
thon

pipe = pipeline("text-classification")
pipe("This restaurant is awesome")
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998743534088135}]

If you want to use a specific model from the hub you can ignore the task if the model on
the hub already defines it:
thon

pipe = pipeline(model="FacebookAI/roberta-large-mnli")
pipe("This restaurant is awesome")
[{'label': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.7313136458396912}]

To call a pipeline on many items, you can call it with a list.
thon

pipe = pipeline("text-classification")
pipe(["This restaurant is awesome", "This restaurant is awful"])
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998743534088135},
 {'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9996669292449951}]

To iterate over full datasets it is recommended to use a dataset directly.
