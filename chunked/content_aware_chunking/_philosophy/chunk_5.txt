Image processors preprocess vision inputs, feature extractors preprocess audio inputs, and a processor handles multimodal inputs.

All these classes can be instantiated from pretrained instances, saved locally, and shared on the Hub with three methods:

from_pretrained() lets you instantiate a model, configuration, and preprocessing class from a pretrained version either
  provided by the library itself (the supported models can be found on the Model Hub) or
  stored locally (or on a server) by the user.
save_pretrained() lets you save a model, configuration, and preprocessing class locally so that it can be reloaded using
  from_pretrained().
push_to_hub() lets you share a model, configuration, and a preprocessing class to the Hub, so it is easily accessible to everyone.
