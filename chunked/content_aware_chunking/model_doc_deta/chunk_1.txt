This leads to significant gains of up to 2.5 mAP.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Detection Transformer (DETR) directly transforms queries to unique objects by using one-to-one bipartite matching during training and enables end-to-end object detection. Recently, these models have surpassed traditional detectors on COCO with undeniable elegance.
