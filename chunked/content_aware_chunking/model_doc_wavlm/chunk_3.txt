We first equip the Transformer structure with gated relative position bias to improve its capability on
recognition tasks. For better speaker discrimination, we propose an utterance mixing training strategy, where
additional overlapped utterances are created unsupervisedly and incorporated during model training. Lastly, we scale up
the training dataset from 60k hours to 94k hours.
