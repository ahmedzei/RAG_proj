As speech signal contains multi-faceted information including speaker
identity, paralinguistics, spoken content, etc., learning universal representations for all speech tasks is
challenging. In this paper, we propose a new pre-trained model, WavLM, to solve full-stack downstream speech tasks.
WavLM is built based on the HuBERT framework, with an emphasis on both spoken content modeling and speaker identity
preservation.
