Please use
  [Wav2Vec2Processor] for the feature extraction.
WavLM model can be fine-tuned using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) so the model output has to be decoded
  using [Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer].
WavLM performs especially well on speaker verification, speaker identification, and speaker diarization tasks.
