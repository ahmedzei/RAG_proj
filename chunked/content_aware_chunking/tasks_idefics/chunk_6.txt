The IDEFICS processor wraps a [LlamaTokenizer] and IDEFICS image processor into a single processor to take care of 
preparing text and image inputs for the model.

import torch
from transformers import IdeficsForVisionText2Text, AutoProcessor
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
model = IdeficsForVisionText2Text.from_pretrained(checkpoint, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")

Setting device_map to "auto" will automatically determine how to load and store the model weights in the most optimized 
manner given existing devices.
Quantized model
If high-memory GPU availability is an issue, you can load the quantized version of the model.
