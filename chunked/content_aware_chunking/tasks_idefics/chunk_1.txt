This approach is no longer limited to a single modality, such as text, and in this guide, we will illustrate how you can 
solve image-text tasks with a large multimodal model called IDEFICS. 
IDEFICS is an open-access vision and language model based on Flamingo, 
a state-of-the-art visual language model initially developed by DeepMind. The model accepts arbitrary sequences of image 
and text inputs and generates coherent text as output.
