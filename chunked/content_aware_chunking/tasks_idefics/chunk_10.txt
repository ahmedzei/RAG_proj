Let's take 
another image to illustrate:

Textual and image prompts can be passed to the model's processor as a single list to create appropriate inputs.

prompt = [
     "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543349689-9a4d426bee8e?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=3501&q=80",
     "This is an image of ",
 ]
inputs = processor(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
bad_words_ids = processor.tokenizer(["", ""], add_special_tokens=False).input_ids
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=10, bad_words_ids=bad_words_ids)
generated_text = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text[0])
This is an image of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.

Few-shot prompting
While IDEFICS demonstrates great zero-shot results, your task may require a certain format of the caption, or come with 
other restrictions or requirements that increase task's complexity.
