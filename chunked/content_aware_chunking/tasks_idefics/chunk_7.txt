To load the model and the 
processor in 4bit precision, pass a BitsAndBytesConfig to the from_pretrained method and the model will be compressed 
on the fly while loading.

import torch
from transformers import IdeficsForVisionText2Text, AutoProcessor, BitsAndBytesConfig
quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
     load_in_4bit=True,
     bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,
 )
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
model = IdeficsForVisionText2Text.from_pretrained(
     checkpoint,
     quantization_config=quantization_config,
     device_map="auto"
 )

Now that you have the model loaded in one of the suggested ways, let's move on to exploring tasks that you can use IDEFICS for.
Image captioning
Image captioning is the task of predicting a caption for a given image.
