The use and prompting for the conversational use is very similar to using the base models: 

import torch
from transformers import IdeficsForVisionText2Text, AutoProcessor
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
checkpoint = "HuggingFaceM4/idefics-9b-instruct"
model = IdeficsForVisionText2Text.from_pretrained(checkpoint, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to(device)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
prompts = [
     [
         "User: What is in this image?
