Few-shot prompting can be used to enable in-context learning.
By providing examples in the prompt, you can steer the model to generate results that mimic the format of given examples. 
Let's use the previous image of the Eiffel Tower as an example for the model and build a prompt that demonstrates to the model 
that in addition to learning what the object in an image is, we would also like to get some interesting information about it.
