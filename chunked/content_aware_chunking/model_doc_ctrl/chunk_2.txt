We release CTRL, a 1.63 billion-parameter conditional transformer language model,
trained to condition on control codes that govern style, content, and task-specific behavior. Control codes were
derived from structure that naturally co-occurs with raw text, preserving the advantages of unsupervised learning while
providing more explicit control over text generation. These codes also allow CTRL to predict which parts of the
training data are most likely given a sequence.
