Leveraging this feature allows CTRL to generate syntactically coherent text as it can be
  observed in the run_generation.py example script.
The PyTorch models can take the past_key_values as input, which is the previously computed key/value attention pairs.
  TensorFlow models accepts past as input. Using the past_key_values value prevents the model from re-computing
  pre-computed values in the context of text generation.
