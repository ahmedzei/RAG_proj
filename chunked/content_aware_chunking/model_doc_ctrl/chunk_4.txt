Refer to the original implementation for
  more information.
CTRL is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than
  the left.
CTRL was trained with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective and is therefore powerful at predicting the next
  token in a sequence.
