Pipelines on the other hand (and mostly the underlying models)
are not really great for parallelism; they take up a lot of RAM, so it's best to give them all the available resources when they are running or it's a compute-intensive job.
We are going to solve that by having the webserver handle the light load of receiving
and sending requests, and having a single thread handling the actual work.
This example is going to use starlette.
