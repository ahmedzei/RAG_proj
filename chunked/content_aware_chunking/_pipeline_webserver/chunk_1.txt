Are you on CPU or GPU? Do
you want the lowest latency, the highest throughput, support for
many models, or just highly optimize 1 specific model?
There are many ways to tackle this topic, so what we are going to present is a good default
to get started which may not necessarily be the most optimal solution for you.

The key thing to understand is that we can use an iterator, just like you would on a
dataset, since a webserver is basically a system that waits for requests and
treats them as they come in.
Usually webservers are multiplexed (multithreaded, async, etc..) to handle various
requests concurrently.
