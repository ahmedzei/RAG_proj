It would be better to have a single 1ms deadline.
This will always wait for 1ms even if the queue is empty, which might not be the
best since you probably want to start doing inference if there's nothing in the queue.
But maybe it does make sense if batching is really crucial for your use case.
Again, there's really no one best solution.
Few things you might want to consider
Error checking
There's a lot that can go wrong in production: out of memory, out of space,
loading the model might fail, the query might be wrong, the query might be
correct but still fail to run because of a model misconfiguration, and so on.
Generally, it's good if the server outputs the errors to the user, so
adding a lot of try..except statements to show those errors is a good
idea.
