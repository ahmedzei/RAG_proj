For now, in all .from_pretrained() calls, you should use the from_pt=True flag to load
the existing PyTorch weights.
After you're done, it's time for the moment of truth: run the tests! ðŸ˜¬

NVIDIA_TF32_OVERRIDE=0 RUN_SLOW=1 RUN_PT_TF_CROSS_TESTS=1 \
py.test -vv tests/models/brand_new_bert/test_modeling_tf_brand_new_bert.py
The most likely outcome is that you'll see a bunch of errors.
