Writing a new model
is no small feat, but hopefully this guide will make it less of a rollercoaster ðŸŽ¢ and more of a walk in the park ðŸš¶.
Harnessing our collective experiences is absolutely critical to make this process increasingly easier, and thus we
highly encourage that you suggest improvements to this guide!
Before you dive deeper, it is recommended that you check the following resources if you're new to ðŸ¤— Transformers:
- General overview of ðŸ¤— Transformers
- Hugging Face's TensorFlow Philosophy
In the remainder of this guide, you will learn what's needed to add a new TensorFlow model architecture, the
procedure to convert PyTorch into TensorFlow model weights, and how to efficiently debug mismatches across ML
frameworks.
