From
experience, we can tell you a few important things about adding TensorFlow models:

Don't reinvent the wheel! More often than not, there are at least two reference implementations you should check: the
PyTorch equivalent of the model you are implementing and other TensorFlow models for the same class of problems.
Great model implementations survive the test of time. This doesn't happen because the code is pretty, but rather
because the code is clear, easy to debug and build upon.
