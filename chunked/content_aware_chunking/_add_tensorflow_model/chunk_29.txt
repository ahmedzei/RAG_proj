You can call the TensorFlow model using the expected input format
5. Add model tests
Hurray, you've implemented a TensorFlow model! Now it's time to add tests to make sure that your model behaves as
expected. As in the previous section, we suggest you start by copying the test_modeling_brand_new_bert.py file in
tests/models/brand_new_bert/ into test_modeling_tf_brand_new_bert.py, and continue by making the necessary
TensorFlow replacements.
