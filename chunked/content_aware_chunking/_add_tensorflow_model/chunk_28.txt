All layers that behave differently at train time (e.g. Dropout) are called with a training argument, which is
propagated all the way from the top-level classes
2. You have used #copied from  whenever possible
3. TFBrandNewBertMainLayer and all classes that use it have their call function decorated with @unpack_inputs
4. TFBrandNewBertMainLayer is decorated with @keras_serializable
5. A TensorFlow model can be loaded from PyTorch weights using TFBrandNewBert.from_pretrained(model_repo, from_pt=True)
