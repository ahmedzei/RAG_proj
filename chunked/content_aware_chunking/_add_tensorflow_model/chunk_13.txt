If that's the case make sure to install TensorFlow then do:

pip install -e ".[quality]"
Note: You don't need to have CUDA installed. Making the new model work on CPU is sufficient.

Create a branch with a descriptive name from your main branch

git checkout -b add_tf_brand_new_bert

Fetch and rebase to current main

git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

Add an empty .py file in transformers/src/models/brandnewbert/ named modeling_tf_brandnewbert.py.
