See the following
   example: PyTorch /
   TensorFlow
- If the PyTorch model has a #copied from  on top of a function, the odds are that your TensorFlow model can also
   borrow that function from the architecture it was copied from, assuming it has a TensorFlow architecture.
- Assigning the name attribute correctly in TensorFlow functions is critical to do the from_pt=True weight
   cross-loading. name is almost always the name of the corresponding variable in the PyTorch code.
