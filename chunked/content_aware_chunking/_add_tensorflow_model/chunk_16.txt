(Optional) Understand theoretical aspects and the existing implementation
You should take some time to read BrandNewBert's paper, if such descriptive work exists. There might be large
sections of the paper that are difficult to understand. If this is the case, this is fine - don't worry! The goal is
not to get a deep theoretical understanding of the paper, but to extract the necessary information required to
effectively re-implement the model in ðŸ¤— Transformers using TensorFlow.
