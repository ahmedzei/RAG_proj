If the specific model you want to use with TensorFlow already has a TensorFlow architecture implementation in
ðŸ¤— Transformers but is lacking weights, feel free to jump straight into the
weight conversion section
of this page.
For simplicity, the remainder of this guide assumes you've decided to contribute with the TensorFlow version of
BrandNewBert (the same example as in the guide to add a new model from scratch).

Before starting the work on a TensorFlow model architecture, double-check that there is no ongoing effort to do so.
You can search for BrandNewBert on the
pull request GitHub page to confirm that there is no
TensorFlow-related pull request.
