The abstract from the paper is the following: 
We introduce MADLAD-400, a manually audited, general domain 3T token monolingual dataset based on CommonCrawl, spanning 419 languages. We discuss 
the limitations revealed by self-auditing MADLAD-400, and the role data auditing
had in the dataset creation process.
