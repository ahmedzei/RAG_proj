FNet
Overview
The FNet model was proposed in FNet: Mixing Tokens with Fourier Transforms by
James Lee-Thorp, Joshua Ainslie, Ilya Eckstein, Santiago Ontanon. The model replaces the self-attention layer in a BERT
model with a fourier transform which returns only the real parts of the transform. The model is significantly faster
than the BERT model because it has fewer parameters and is more memory efficient.
