These linear mixers, along with
standard nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, prove competent at modeling semantic relationships in several text
classification tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder
with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE
benchmark, but trains 80% faster on GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths.
