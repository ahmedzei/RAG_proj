First, we apply the multi-task learning to
the current SSL framework, where we integrate the utterance-wise contrastive loss with the SSL objective function.
Second, for better speaker discrimination, we propose an utterance mixing strategy for data augmentation, where
additional overlapped utterances are created unsupervisedly and incorporate during training. We integrate the proposed
methods into the HuBERT framework.
