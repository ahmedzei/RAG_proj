Experiment results on SUPERB benchmark show that the proposed system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in universal representation learning, especially for speaker identification oriented
tasks. An ablation study is performed verifying the efficacy of each proposed method. Finally, we scale up training
dataset to 94 thousand hours public audio data and achieve further performance improvement in all SUPERB tasks.
