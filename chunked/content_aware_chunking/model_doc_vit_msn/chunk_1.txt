With this setup, their method yields excellent performance in the low-shot and extreme low-shot
regimes.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We propose Masked Siamese Networks (MSN), a self-supervised learning framework for learning image representations. Our
approach matches the representation of an image view containing randomly masked patches to the representation of the original
unmasked image.
