ViTMSN
Overview
The ViTMSN model was proposed in Masked Siamese Networks for Label-Efficient Learning by Mahmoud Assran, Mathilde Caron, Ishan Misra, Piotr Bojanowski, Florian Bordes,
Pascal Vincent, Armand Joulin, Michael Rabbat, Nicolas Ballas. The paper presents a joint-embedding architecture to match the prototypes
of masked patches with that of the unmasked patches.
