Experiment results show that LayoutLMv2 outperforms strong baselines and
achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of downstream visually-rich document understanding tasks,
including FUNSD (0.7895 -> 0.8420), CORD (0.9493 -> 0.9601), SROIE (0.9524 -> 0.9781), Kleister-NDA (0.834 -> 0.852),
RVL-CDIP (0.9443 -> 0.9564), and DocVQA (0.7295 -> 0.8672). The pre-trained LayoutLMv2 model is publicly available at
this https URL.
LayoutLMv2 depends on detectron2, torchvision and tesseract.
