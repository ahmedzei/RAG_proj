section below.

Internally, [~transformers.LayoutLMv2Model] will send the image input through its visual backbone to
  obtain a lower-resolution feature map, whose shape is equal to the image_feature_pool_shape attribute of
  [~transformers.LayoutLMv2Config]. This feature map is then flattened to obtain a sequence of image tokens. As
  the size of the feature map is 7x7 by default, one obtains 49 image tokens.
