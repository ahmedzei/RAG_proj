Run the
following to install them:

python -m pip install torchvision tesseract
(If you are developing for LayoutLMv2, note that passing the doctests also requires the installation of these packages.)
Usage tips

The main difference between LayoutLMv1 and LayoutLMv2 is that the latter incorporates visual embeddings during
  pre-training (while LayoutLMv1 only adds visual embeddings during fine-tuning).
LayoutLMv2 adds both a relative 1D attention bias as well as a spatial 2D attention bias to the attention scores in
  the self-attention layers.
