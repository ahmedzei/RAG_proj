Internally, the processor first uses
[LayoutLMv2ImageProcessor] to apply OCR on the image to get a list of words and normalized
bounding boxes, as well to resize the image to a given size in order to get the image input. The words and
normalized bounding boxes are then provided to [LayoutLMv2Tokenizer] or
[LayoutLMv2TokenizerFast], which converts them to token-level input_ids,
attention_mask, token_type_ids, bbox.
