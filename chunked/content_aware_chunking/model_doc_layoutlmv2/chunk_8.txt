The bbox input are the bounding boxes (i.e. 2D-positions)
  of the input text tokens. This is identical to [LayoutLMModel]. These can be obtained using an
  external OCR engine such as Google's Tesseract (there's a Python
  wrapper available). Each bounding box should be in (x0, y0, x1, y1)
  format, where (x0, y0) corresponds to the position of the upper left corner in the bounding box, and (x1, y1)
  represents the position of the lower right corner.
