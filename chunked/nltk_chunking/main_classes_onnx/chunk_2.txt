ONNX Configurations
We provide three abstract classes that you should inherit from, depending on the
type of model architecture you wish to export:

Encoder-based models inherit from [~onnx.config.OnnxConfig]
Decoder-based models inherit from [~onnx.config.OnnxConfigWithPast]
Encoder-decoder models inherit from [~onnx.config.OnnxSeq2SeqConfigWithPast]

OnnxConfig
[[autodoc]] onnx.config.OnnxConfig
OnnxConfigWithPast
[[autodoc]] onnx.config.OnnxConfigWithPast
OnnxSeq2SeqConfigWithPast
[[autodoc]] onnx.config.OnnxSeq2SeqConfigWithPast
ONNX Features
Each ONNX configuration is associated with a set of features that enable you
to export models for different types of topologies or tasks.
