Models
The base classes [PreTrainedModel], [TFPreTrainedModel], and
[FlaxPreTrainedModel] implement the common methods for loading/saving a model either from a local
file or directory, or from a pretrained model configuration provided by the library (downloaded from HuggingFace's AWS
S3 repository).
