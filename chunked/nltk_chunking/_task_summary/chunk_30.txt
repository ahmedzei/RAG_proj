Some example applications of object detection include:

self-driving vehicles: detect everyday traffic objects such as other vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights
remote sensing: disaster monitoring, urban planning, and weather forecasting
defect detection: detect cracks or structural damage in buildings, and manufacturing defects

from transformers import pipeline
detector = pipeline(task="object-detection")
preds = detector(

 )
preds = [{"score": round(pred["score"], 4), "label": pred["label"], "box": pred["box"]} for pred in preds]

[{'score': 0.9865,
  'label': 'cat',
  'box': {'xmin': 178, 'ymin': 154, 'xmax': 882, 'ymax': 598}}]

Image segmentation
Image segmentation is a pixel-level task that assigns every pixel in an image to a class.
