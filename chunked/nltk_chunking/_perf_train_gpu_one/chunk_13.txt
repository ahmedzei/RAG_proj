If these methods do not result in sufficient gains, you can explore the following options: 
* Look into building your own custom Docker container with efficient softare prebuilds
* Consider a model that uses Mixture of Experts (MoE)
* Convert your model to BetterTransformer to leverage PyTorch native attention
Finally, if all of the above is still not enough, even after switching to a server-grade GPU like A100, consider moving 
to a multi-GPU setup.
