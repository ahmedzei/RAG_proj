Remove the columns you don't need, and rename intent_class to label because that's the name the model expects:

encoded_minds = minds.map(preprocess_function, remove_columns="audio", batched=True)
encoded_minds = encoded_minds.rename_column("intent_class", "label")

Evaluate
Including a metric during training is often helpful for evaluating your model's performance.
