The
[PreTrainedTokenizerFast] class allows for easy instantiation, by accepting the instantiated
tokenizer object as an argument:
thon

from transformers import PreTrainedTokenizerFast
fast_tokenizer = PreTrainedTokenizerFast(tokenizer_object=tokenizer)

This object can now be used with all the methods shared by the ðŸ¤— Transformers tokenizers!
