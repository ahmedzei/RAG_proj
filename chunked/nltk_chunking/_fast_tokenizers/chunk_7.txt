Loading from a JSON file
In order to load a tokenizer from a JSON file, let's first start by saving our tokenizer:
thon

tokenizer.save("tokenizer.json")

The path to which we saved this file can be passed to the [PreTrainedTokenizerFast] initialization
method using the tokenizer_file parameter:
thon

from transformers import PreTrainedTokenizerFast
fast_tokenizer = PreTrainedTokenizerFast(tokenizer_file="tokenizer.json")

This object can now be used with all the methods shared by the ðŸ¤— Transformers tokenizers!
