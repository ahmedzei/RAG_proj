To normalize, you can use the following function:

python
def normalize_bbox(bbox, width, height):
    return [
        int(1000 * (bbox[0] / width)),
        int(1000 * (bbox[1] / height)),
        int(1000 * (bbox[2] / width)),
        int(1000 * (bbox[3] / height)),
    ]
Here, width and height correspond to the width and height of the original document in which the token
occurs (before resizing the image).
