BERT
The following BERT models can be used for multilingual tasks:

google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-uncased (Masked language modeling + Next sentence prediction, 102 languages)
google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased (Masked language modeling + Next sentence prediction, 104 languages)

These models do not require language embeddings during inference.
