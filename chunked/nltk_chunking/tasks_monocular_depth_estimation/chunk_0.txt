In this guide you'll learn how to:

create a depth estimation pipeline
run depth estimation inference by hand

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:

pip install -q transformers
Depth estimation pipeline
The simplest way to try out inference with a model supporting depth estimation is to use the corresponding [pipeline].
