In order of fastest and most memory-efficient:
| Fastest          | Memory efficient |
|------------------|------------------|
| ZeRO-1           | ZeRO-3 + offload |
| ZeRO-2           | ZeRO-3           |
| ZeRO-2 + offload | ZeRO-2 + offload |
| ZeRO-3           | ZeRO-2           |
| ZeRO-3 + offload | ZeRO-1           |
To find what works best for you, start with the fastest approach and if you run out of memory, try the next stage which is slower but more memory efficient.
