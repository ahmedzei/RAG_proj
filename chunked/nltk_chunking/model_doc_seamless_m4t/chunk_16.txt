Usage
First, load the processor and a checkpoint of the model:
thon

from transformers import AutoProcessor, SeamlessM4TModel
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium")
model = SeamlessM4TModel.from_pretrained("facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium")

You can seamlessly use this model on text or on audio, to generated either translated text or translated audio.
