prompt = f"Question: {question} Answer:" 

Now we need to preprocess the image/prompt with the model's processor, pass the processed input through the model, and decode the output:

inputs = processor(image, text=prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device, torch.float16)
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=10)
generated_text = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0].strip()
print(generated_text)
"He is looking at the crowd" 

As you can see, the model recognized the crowd, and the direction of the face (looking down), however, it seems to miss 
the fact the crowd is behind the skater.
