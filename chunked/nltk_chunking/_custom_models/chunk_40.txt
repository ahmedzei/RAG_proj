As long as your config has a model_type attribute that is different from existing model types, and that your model
classes have the right config_class attributes, you can just add them to the auto classes like this:

from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModel, AutoModelForImageClassification
AutoConfig.register("resnet", ResnetConfig)
AutoModel.register(ResnetConfig, ResnetModel)
AutoModelForImageClassification.register(ResnetConfig, ResnetModelForImageClassification)

Note that the first argument used when registering your custom config to [AutoConfig] needs to match the model_type
of your custom config, and the first argument used when registering your custom models to any auto model class needs
to match the config_class of those models.
