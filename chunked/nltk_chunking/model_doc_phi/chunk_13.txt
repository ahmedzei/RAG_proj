We follow the “Textbooks Are All You Need” approach, focusing this time on common
sense reasoning in natural language, and create a new 1.3 billion parameter model named phi-1.5,
with performance on natural language tasks comparable to models 5x larger, and surpassing most
non-frontier LLMs on more complex reasoning tasks such as grade-school mathematics and basic
coding.
