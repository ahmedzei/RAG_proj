and you could run just the negative and integer sets of params with:

pytest -k "negative and integer" tests/test_mytest.py
or all but negative sub-tests, with:

pytest -k "not negative" tests/test_mytest.py
Besides using the -k filter that was just mentioned, you can find out the exact name of each sub-test and run any
or all of them using their exact names.
