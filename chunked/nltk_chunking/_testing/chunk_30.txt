If the default for this value does not work for you, you can change it in your project by setting a configuration
option in setup.cfg:
ini
[tool:pytest]
looponfailroots = transformers tests
or pytest.ini/tox.ini files:
ini
[pytest]
looponfailroots = transformers tests
This would lead to only looking for file changes in the respective directories, specified relatively to the ini-fileâ€™s
directory.
