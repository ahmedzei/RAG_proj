To run all tests except those whose name contains adam:

pytest -k "not adam" tests/test_optimization.py
And you can combine the two patterns in one:

pytest -k "ada and not adam" tests/test_optimization.py
For example to run both test_adafactor and test_adam_w you can use:

pytest -k "test_adam_w or test_adam_w" tests/test_optimization.py
Note that we use or here, since we want either of the keywords to match to include both.
