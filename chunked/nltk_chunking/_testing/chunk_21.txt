For that you can just add -m accelerate_tests to your command, if let's say you want to run these tests on OPT run:

RUN_SLOW=1 pytest -m accelerate_tests tests/models/opt/test_modeling_opt.py
Run documentation tests
In order to test whether the documentation examples are correct, you should check that the doctests are passing.
