Experimental results show that PhoBERT consistently outperforms the recent
best pre-trained multilingual model XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) and improves the state-of-the-art in multiple
Vietnamese-specific NLP tasks including Part-of-speech tagging, Dependency parsing, Named-entity recognition and
Natural language inference.
