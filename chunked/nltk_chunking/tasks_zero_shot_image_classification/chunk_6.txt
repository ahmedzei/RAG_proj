In this guide you'll learn how to:

create a zero-shot image classification pipeline
run zero-shot image classification inference by hand

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:

pip install -q transformers
Zero-shot image classification pipeline
The simplest way to try out inference with a model supporting zero-shot image classification is to use the corresponding [pipeline].
