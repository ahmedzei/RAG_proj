This library hosts a processor for each of the two versions:
Processors
Those processors are:

[~data.processors.utils.SquadV1Processor]
[~data.processors.utils.SquadV2Processor]

They both inherit from the abstract class [~data.processors.utils.SquadProcessor]
[[autodoc]] data.processors.squad.SquadProcessor
    - all
Additionally, the following method can be used to convert SQuAD examples into
[~data.processors.utils.SquadFeatures] that can be used as model inputs.
