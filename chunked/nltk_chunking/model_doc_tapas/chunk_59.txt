Be sure to have installed the tensorflow_probability dependency:

from transformers import TapasConfig, TFTapasForQuestionAnswering
for example, the base sized model with default SQA configuration
model = TFTapasForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google/tapas-base")
or, the base sized model with WTQ configuration
config = TapasConfig.from_pretrained("google/tapas-base-finetuned-wtq")
model = TFTapasForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google/tapas-base", config=config)
or, the base sized model with WikiSQL configuration
config = TapasConfig("google-base-finetuned-wikisql-supervised")
model = TFTapasForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google/tapas-base", config=config)

Of course, you don't necessarily have to follow one of these three ways in which TAPAS was fine-tuned.
