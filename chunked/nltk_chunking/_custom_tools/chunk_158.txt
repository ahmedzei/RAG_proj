Let's name this file
model_downloads.py, so the resulting import code looks like this:
thon
from model_downloads import HFModelDownloadsTool
tool = HFModelDownloadsTool()

In order to let others benefit from it and for simpler initialization, we recommend pushing it to the Hub under your 
namespace.
