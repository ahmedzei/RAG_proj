You can always have a look at the toolbox that is currently available to the agent via the agent.toolbox attribute:
py
print("\n".join([f"- {a}" for a in agent.toolbox.keys()]))
text
- document_qa
- image_captioner
- image_qa

- transcriber
- summarizer
- text_classifier
- text_qa
- text_reader
- translator
- image_transformer
- text_downloader
- image_generator
- video_generator

Note how image_upscaler is now part of the agents' toolbox.
