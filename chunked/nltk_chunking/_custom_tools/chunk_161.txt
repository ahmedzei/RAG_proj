Having the agent use the tool
We now have our tool that lives on the Hub which can be instantiated as such (change the user name for your tool):
thon
from transformers import load_tool
tool = load_tool("lysandre/hf-model-downloads")

In order to use it in the agent, simply pass it in the additional_tools parameter of the agent initialization method:
thon
from transformers import HfAgent
agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder", additional_tools=[tool])
agent.run(
    "Can you read out loud the name of the model that has the most downloads in the 'text-to-video' task on the Hugging Face Hub?"
