We can do that with the following code:
thon
from huggingface_hub import list_models
task = "text-classification"
model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort="downloads", direction=-1)))
print(model.id)

For the task text-classification, this returns 'facebook/bart-large-mnli', for translation it returns 'google-t5/t5-base.
