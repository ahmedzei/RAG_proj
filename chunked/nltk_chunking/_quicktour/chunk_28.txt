Load a tokenizer with [AutoTokenizer]:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
model_name = "nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

Pass your text to the tokenizer:

encoding = tokenizer("We are very happy to show you the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.")
