Extract the raw waveform arrays from the first 4 samples and pass it as a list to the pipeline:

result = speech_recognizer(dataset[:4]["audio"])
print([d["text"] for d in result])
['I WOULD LIKE TO SET UP A JOINT ACCOUNT WITH MY PARTNER HOW DO I PROCEED WITH DOING THAT', "FONDERING HOW I'D SET UP A JOIN TO HELL T WITH MY WIFE AND WHERE THE AP MIGHT BE", "I I'D LIKE TOY SET UP A JOINT ACCOUNT WITH MY PARTNER I'M NOT SEEING THE OPTION TO DO IT ON THE APSO I CALLED IN TO GET SOME HELP CAN I JUST DO IT OVER THE PHONE WITH YOU AND GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION OR SHOULD I DO IT IN THE AP AN I'M MISSING SOMETHING UQUETTE HAD PREFERRED TO JUST DO IT OVER THE PHONE OF POSSIBLE THINGS", 'HOW DO I FURN A JOINA COUT']

For larger datasets where the inputs are big (like in speech or vision), you'll want to pass a generator instead of a list to load all the inputs in memory.
