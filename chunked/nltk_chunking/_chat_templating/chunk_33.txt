Here's an example of preparing input for model.generate(), using the Zephyr assistant model:
thon
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
checkpoint = "HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta"

messages = [

        "content": "You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate",
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting?
