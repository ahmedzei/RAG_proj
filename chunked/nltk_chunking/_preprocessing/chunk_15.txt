This downloads the vocab a model was pretrained with:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-cased")

Then pass your text to the tokenizer:

encoded_input = tokenizer("Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.")
