If you want to use the ASR pipeline, you can load your chosen target language as such:

from transformers import pipeline
model_id = "facebook/mms-1b-all"
target_lang = "fra"
pipe = pipeline(model=model_id, model_kwargs={"target_lang": "fra", "ignore_mismatched_sizes": True})

Inference
Next, let's look at how we can run MMS in inference and change adapter layers after having called [~PretrainedModel.from_pretrained]
First, we load audio data in different languages using the Datasets.
