Similarly, the processor should be loaded with the same target language

from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, AutoProcessor
model_id = "facebook/mms-1b-all"
target_lang = "fra"
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, target_lang=target_lang)
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(model_id, target_lang=target_lang, ignore_mismatched_sizes=True)

You can safely ignore a warning such as:
text
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForCTC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/mms-1b-all and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- lm_head.bias: found shape torch.Size([154]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([314]) in the model instantiated
- lm_head.weight: found shape torch.Size([154, 1280]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([314, 1280]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
