If you look at NumPy or PyTorch loss functions that support label masking, you will often see code like this that uses boolean indexing:
python
label_mask = labels >= 0
masked_outputs = outputs[label_mask]
masked_labels = labels[label_mask]
loss = compute_loss(masked_outputs, masked_labels)
mean_loss = torch.mean(loss)
This code is totally fine in NumPy or PyTorch, but it breaks in XLA!
