Difference in the speech encoder
The speech encoder, which is used during the first-pass generation process to predict the translated text, differs mainly from the previous speech encoder through these mechanisms:
- the use of chunked attention mask to prevent attention across chunks, ensuring that each position attends only to positions within its own chunk and a fixed number of previous chunks.
