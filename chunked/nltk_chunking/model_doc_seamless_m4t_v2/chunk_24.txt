let's load an audio sample from an Arabic speech corpus
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("arabic_speech_corpus", split="test", streaming=True)
audio_sample = next(iter(dataset))["audio"]
now, process it
audio_inputs = processor(audios=audio_sample["array"], return_tensors="pt")
now, process some English text as well
text_inputs = processor(text = "Hello, my dog is cute", src_lang="eng", return_tensors="pt")
