For instance, if you have defined a
custom class of model NewModel, make sure you have a NewModelConfig then you can add those to the auto
classes like this:
thon
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModel
AutoConfig.register("new-model", NewModelConfig)
AutoModel.register(NewModelConfig, NewModel)

You will then be able to use the auto classes like you would usually do!
