Start by defining the hyperparameters, optimizer and learning rate schedule:

from transformers import create_optimizer
batch_size = 2
num_epochs = 50
num_train_steps = len(train_ds) * num_epochs
learning_rate = 6e-5
weight_decay_rate = 0.01
optimizer, lr_schedule = create_optimizer(
     init_lr=learning_rate,
     num_train_steps=num_train_steps,
     weight_decay_rate=weight_decay_rate,
     num_warmup_steps=0,
 )

Then, load SegFormer with [TFAutoModelForSemanticSegmentation] along with the label mappings, and compile it with the
optimizer.
