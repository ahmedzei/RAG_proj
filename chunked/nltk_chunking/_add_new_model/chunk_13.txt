As a result of our way of working, there are some choices that we try to apply to all models:

Composition is generally favored over-abstraction
Duplicating code is not always bad if it strongly improves the readability or accessibility of a model
Model files are as self-contained as possible so that when you read the code of a specific model, you ideally only
  have to look into the respective modeling_.py file.
