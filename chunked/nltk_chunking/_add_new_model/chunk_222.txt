layer_name = "dense"
pretrained_weight = array_of_dense_layer
model_pointer = getattr(model, "dense")
model_pointer.weight.data = torch.from_numpy(pretrained_weight)

While doing so, you must verify that each randomly initialized weight of your PyTorch model and its corresponding
pretrained checkpoint weight exactly match in both shape and name.
