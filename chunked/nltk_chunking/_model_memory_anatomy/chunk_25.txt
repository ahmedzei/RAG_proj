First, we set up a few standard training 
arguments:
py
default_args = {
    "output_dir": "tmp",
    "evaluation_strategy": "steps",
    "num_train_epochs": 1,
    "log_level": "error",
    "report_to": "none",
}

If you plan to run multiple experiments, in order to properly clear the memory between experiments, restart the Python 
 kernel between experiments.
