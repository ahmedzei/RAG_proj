At longer input lengths,
our FNet model is significantly faster: when compared to the "efficient" Transformers on the Long Range Arena
benchmark, FNet matches the accuracy of the most accurate models, while outpacing the fastest models across all
sequence lengths on GPUs (and across relatively shorter lengths on TPUs).
