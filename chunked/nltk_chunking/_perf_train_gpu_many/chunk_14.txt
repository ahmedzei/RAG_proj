Case 2: Your model doesn't fit onto a single GPU:
If your model is too large for a single GPU, you have several alternatives to consider:

PipelineParallel (PP)
ZeRO
TensorParallel (TP)

With very fast inter-node connectivity (e.g., NVLINK or NVSwitch) all three strategies (PP, ZeRO, TP) should result in 
similar performance.
