Layer La, for example, has weights a0, a1 and a2:
La | Lb | Lc
---|----|---
a0 | b0 | c0
a1 | b1 | c1
a2 | b2 | c2
If we have 3 GPUs, ZeRO-DP splits the model onto 3 GPUs like so:

GPU0:
La | Lb | Lc
---|----|---
a0 | b0 | c0
GPU1:
La | Lb | Lc
---|----|---
a1 | b1 | c1
GPU2:
La | Lb | Lc
---|----|---
a2 | b2 | c2

In a way, this is the same horizontal slicing as tensor parallelism, as opposed to Vertical 
slicing, where one puts whole layer-groups on different GPUs.
