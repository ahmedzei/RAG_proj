You can either order them by:

PCIe bus ID's that matches the order of nvidia-smi and rocm-smi for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs respectively

export CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID

GPU compute ability

export CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=FASTEST_FIRST
The CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER is especially useful if your training setup consists of an older and newer GPU, where the older GPU appears first, but you cannot physically swap the cards to make the newer GPU appear first.
