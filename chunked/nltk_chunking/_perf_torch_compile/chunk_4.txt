To compile any computer vision model of your choice, call torch.compile() on the model as shown below:

from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID).to("cuda")
+ model = torch.compile(model)

compile()Â comes with multiple modes for compiling, which essentially differ in compilation time and inference overhead.
