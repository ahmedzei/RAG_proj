The abstract from the paper is the following:
In this paper, we propose a unified pre-training approach called UniSpeech to learn speech representations with both
unlabeled and labeled data, in which supervised phonetic CTC learning and phonetically-aware contrastive
self-supervised learning are conducted in a multi-task learning manner.
