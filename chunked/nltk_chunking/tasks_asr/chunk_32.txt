Instantiate a pipeline for automatic speech recognition with your model, and pass your audio file to it:

from transformers import pipeline
transcriber = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition", model="stevhliu/my_awesome_asr_minds_model")
transcriber(audio_file)
{'text': 'I WOUD LIKE O SET UP JOINT ACOUNT WTH Y PARTNER'}

The transcription is decent, but it could be better!
