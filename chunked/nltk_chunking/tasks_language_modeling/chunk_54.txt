Call fit with your training and validation datasets, the number of epochs, and your callback to finetune the model:

model.fit(x=tf_train_set, validation_data=tf_test_set, epochs=3, callbacks=[callback])

Once training is completed, your model is automatically uploaded to the Hub so everyone can use it!
