For instance, the sentence "The cute dog walks in the park" with the masks put on "cute dog" and "the" should be
processed as follows:
thon

from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google-t5/t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google-t5/t5-small")
input_ids = tokenizer("The  walks in  park", return_tensors="pt").input_ids
labels = tokenizer(" cute dog  the ", return_tensors="pt").input_ids
the forward function automatically creates the correct decoder_input_ids
loss = model(input_ids=input_ids, labels=labels).loss
loss.item()
3.7837
