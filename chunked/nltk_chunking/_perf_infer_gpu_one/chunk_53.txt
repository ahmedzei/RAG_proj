If you want to load a model that was not yet exported to ONNX, you can set export=True to convert your model on-the-fly to the ONNX format:

from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassification
ort_model = ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
  "distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english",
  export=True,
  provider="CUDAExecutionProvider",
)

Now you're free to use the model for inference:

from optimum.pipelines import pipeline
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
pipeline = pipeline(task="text-classification", model=ort_model, tokenizer=tokenizer, device="cuda:0")
result = pipeline("Both the music and visual were astounding, not to mention the actors performance.")
