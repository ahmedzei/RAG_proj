For example, to distribute 600MB of memory to the first GPU and 1GB of memory to the second GPU:
py
max_memory_mapping = {0: "600MB", 1: "1GB"}
model_name = "bigscience/bloom-3b"
model_4bit = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name, device_map="auto", load_in_4bit=True, max_memory=max_memory_mapping
)
