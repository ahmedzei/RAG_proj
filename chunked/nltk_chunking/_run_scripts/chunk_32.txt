Make sure you have ðŸ¤— Accelerate installed if you don't already have it:

Note: As Accelerate is rapidly developing, the git version of accelerate must be installed to run the scripts

pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate

Instead of the run_summarization.py script, you need to use the run_summarization_no_trainer.py script.
