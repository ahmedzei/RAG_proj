Unlike AlphaFold2,
it relies on the token embeddings from the large pre-trained protein language model stem and does not perform a multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) step at inference time, which means that ESMFold checkpoints are fully "standalone" -
they do not require a database of known protein sequences and structures with associated external query tools
to make predictions, and are much faster as a result.
