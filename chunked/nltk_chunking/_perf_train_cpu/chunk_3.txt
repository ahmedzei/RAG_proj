To further maximize training performance, you can use Intel® Extension for PyTorch (IPEX), which is a library built on PyTorch and adds additional CPU instruction level architecture (ISA) level support such as Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (Intel® AVX512-VNNI), and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX) for an extra performance boost on Intel CPUs.
