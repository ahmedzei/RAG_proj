For example, load a model for sequence classification with [AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained]:

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")

Easily reuse the same checkpoint to load an architecture for a different task:

from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")

For PyTorch models, the from_pretrained() method uses torch.load() which internally uses pickle and is known to be insecure.
