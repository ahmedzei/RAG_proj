For ease of use, a generator is also possible:
thon
from transformers import pipeline
pipe = pipeline("text-classification")
def data():
    while True:
        # This could come from a dataset, a database, a queue or HTTP request
        # in a server
        # Caveat: because this is iterative, you cannot use num_workers > 1 variable
        # to use multiple threads to preprocess data.
