If you are using throughput (you want to run your model on a bunch of static data), on GPU, then:

If you have no clue about the size of the sequence_length ("natural" data), by default don't batch, measure and
    try tentatively to add it, add OOM checks to recover when it will fail (and it will at some point if you don't
    control the sequence_length.)
