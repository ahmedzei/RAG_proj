Simple call on one item:
thon

pipe = pipeline("text-classification")
pipe("This restaurant is awesome")
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998743534088135}]

If you want to use a specific model from the hub you can ignore the task if the model on
the hub already defines it:
thon

pipe = pipeline(model="FacebookAI/roberta-large-mnli")
pipe("This restaurant is awesome")
[{'label': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.7313136458396912}]

To call a pipeline on many items, you can call it with a list.
