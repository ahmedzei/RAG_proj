If you want to try simply you can:

Subclass your pipeline of choice

thon
class MyPipeline(TextClassificationPipeline):
    def postprocess():
        # Your code goes here
        scores = scores * 100
        # And here
my_pipeline = MyPipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, )
or if you use pipeline function, then:
my_pipeline = pipeline(model="xxxx", pipeline_class=MyPipeline)

That should enable you to do all the custom code you want.
