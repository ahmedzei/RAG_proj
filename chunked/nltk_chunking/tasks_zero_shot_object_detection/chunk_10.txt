In this guide, you will learn how to use OWL-ViT:
- to detect objects based on text prompts
- for batch object detection
- for image-guided object detection
Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:

pip install -q transformers
Zero-shot object detection pipeline
The simplest way to try out inference with OWL-ViT is to use it in a [pipeline].
