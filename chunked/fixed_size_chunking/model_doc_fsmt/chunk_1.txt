tems are large BPE-based transformer models trained with the Fairseq sequence modeling
toolkit which rely on sampled back-translations. This year we experiment with different bitext data filtering schemes,
as well as with adding filtered back-translated data. We also ensemble and fine-tune our models on domain-specific
data, then decode using noisy channel model reranking. Our submissions are ranked first in all four directions of the
human evaluation campaign. On En->De, our system significantly outperform
