 of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of
tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard
sequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than
standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs
favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods. Our code is available at this h
