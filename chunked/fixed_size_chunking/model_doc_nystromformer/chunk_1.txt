nfluence or
dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the
input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the
community. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a
function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention
with O(n) complexity. The scalability
