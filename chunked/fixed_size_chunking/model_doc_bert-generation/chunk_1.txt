hed the state-of-the-art on multiple
benchmarks while saving significant amounts of compute time. So far the focus has been mainly on the Natural Language
Understanding tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of pre-trained checkpoints for Sequence Generation. We
developed a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model that is compatible with publicly available pre-trained BERT,
GPT-2 and RoBERTa checkpoints and conducted an extensive empirical study on the utility of initializing our model, both
