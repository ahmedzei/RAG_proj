eficial for various downstream NLP tasks. Recently, GPT-3,
with 175 billion parameters and 570GB training data, drew a lot of attention due to the capacity of few-shot (even
zero-shot) learning. However, applying GPT-3 to address Chinese NLP tasks is still challenging, as the training corpus
of GPT-3 is primarily English, and the parameters are not publicly available. In this technical report, we release the
Chinese Pre-trained Language Model (CPM) with generative pre-training on large-scale Chinese trainin
