Usage tips

DialoGPT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather
  than the left.
DialoGPT was trained with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective on conversational data and is therefore powerful
  at response generation in open-domain dialogue systems.
