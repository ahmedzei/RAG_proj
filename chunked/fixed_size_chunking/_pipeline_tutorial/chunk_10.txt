This runs the pipeline on the 4 provided audio files, but it will pass them in batches of 2
to the model (which is on a GPU, where batching is more likely to help) without requiring any further code from you. 
The output should always match what you would have received without batching. It is only meant as a way to help you get more speed out of a pipeline.
Pipelines can also alleviate some of the complexities of batching because, for some pipelines, a single item (like a long audio file) n
