der the hood).
This is important because you don't have to allocate memory for the whole dataset

The simplest way to iterate over a dataset is to just load one from ðŸ¤— Datasets:

KeyDataset is a util that will just output the item we're interested in.
from transformers.pipelines.pt_utils import KeyDataset
from datasets import load_dataset
pipe = pipeline(model="hf-
