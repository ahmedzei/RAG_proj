Pipelines for inference
The [pipeline] makes it simple to use any model from the Hub for inference on any language, computer vision, speech, and multimodal tasks. Even if you don't have experience with a specific modality or aren't familiar with the underlying code behind the models, you can still use them for inference with the [pipeline]! This tutorial will teach you to:

Use a [pipeline] for inference.
Use a specific tokenizer or model.
Use a [pipeline] for audio, vision, and multimodal tasks.
