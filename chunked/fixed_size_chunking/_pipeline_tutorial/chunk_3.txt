recognition models 
on the Hub to see if you can get a better transcription.
Let's try the Whisper large-v2 model from OpenAI. Whisper was released 
2 years later than Wav2Vec2, and was trained on close to 10x more data. As such, it beats Wav2Vec2 on most downstream 
benchmarks. It also has the added benefit of predicting punctuation and casing, neither of which are possible with
Wav2Vec2.
Let's give it a try here to see how it performs:

transcriber = pipeline(model="openai/whisper-large-v2")
