PU and you are using PyTorch, you can set device_map="auto" to automatically 
determine how to load and store the model weights. Using the device_map argument requires the ðŸ¤— Accelerate
package:

pip install --upgrade accelerate
The following code automatically loads and stores model weights across devices:
py
transcriber = pipeline(model="openai/whisper-large-v2", device_map="auto")
Note that if  device_map="auto" is passed, there is no need to add the argument device=device when instantiating your pipeline
