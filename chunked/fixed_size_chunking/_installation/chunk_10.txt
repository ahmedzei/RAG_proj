This script should run without hanging or waiting to timeout because it won't attempt to download the model from the Hub.
You can also bypass loading a model from the Hub from each [~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained] call with the [local_files_only] parameter. When set to True, only local files are loaded:

from transformers import T5Model
model = T5Model.from_pretrained("./path/to/local/directory", local_files_only=True)
