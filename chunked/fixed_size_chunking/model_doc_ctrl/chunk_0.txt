Overview
CTRL model was proposed in CTRL: A Conditional Transformer Language Model for Controllable Generation by Nitish Shirish Keskar, Bryan McCann, Lav R. Varshney, Caiming Xiong and
Richard Socher. It's a causal (unidirectional) transformer pre-trained using language modeling on a very large corpus
of ~140 GB of text data with the first token reserved as a control code (such as Links, Books, Wikipedia etc.).
The abstract from the paper is the following:
