to the state-of-the-art. The latter work proposed to use existing Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate “textbook quality” data as a way to enhance the learning process compared to traditional
web data. We follow the “Textbooks Are All You Need” approach, focusing this time on common

with performance on natural language tasks comparable to models 5x larger, and surpassing most
non-frontier LLMs on more
