Summary
In Phi-1 and Phi-1.5 papers, the authors showed how important the quality of the data is in training relative to the model size.
They selected high quality "textbook" data alongside with synthetically generated data for training their small sized Transformer
based model Phi-1 with 1.3B parameters. Despite this small scale, phi-1 attains pass@1 accuracy 50.6% on HumanEval and 55.5% on MBPP.
They follow the same strategy for Phi-1.5 and created a
