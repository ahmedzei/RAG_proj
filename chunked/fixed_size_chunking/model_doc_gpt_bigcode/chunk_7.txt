Attention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of flash-attn repository. Make also sure to load your model in half-precision (e.g. `torch.float16``)
To load and run a model using Flash Attention 2, refer to the snippet below:
thon

import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("bigcode/gpt_bigcode-santacoder", torch_dtype=torch.float16, attn_implementation="flash_attent
