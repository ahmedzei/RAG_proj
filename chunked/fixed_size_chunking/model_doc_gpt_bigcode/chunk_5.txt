oftmax_in_fp32
- Cache the attention mask value to avoid recreating it every time.
- Use jit to fuse the attention fp32 casting, masking, softmax, and scaling.
- Combine the attention and causal masks into a single one, pre-computed for the whole model instead of every layer.
- Merge the key and value caches into one (this changes the format of layer_past/ present, does it risk creating problems?)
- Use the memory layout (self.num_heads, 3, self.head_dim) instead of (3, self.num_heads, self.head_dim) for th
