Set the language id as "en" and use it to define the language embedding. The language embedding is a tensor filled with 0 since that is the language id for English. This tensor should be the same size as input_ids. 

language_id = tokenizer.lang2id["en"]  # 0
langs = torch.tensor([language_id] * input_ids.shape[1])  # torch.tensor([0, 0, 0, , 0])
We reshape it to be of size (batch_size, sequence_length)
langs = langs.view(1, -1)  # is now of shape [1, sequence
