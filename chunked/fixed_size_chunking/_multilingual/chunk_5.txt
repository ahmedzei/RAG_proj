_length] (we have a batch size of 1)

Now you can pass the input_ids and language embedding to the model:

outputs = model(input_ids, langs=langs)

The run_generation.py script can generate text with language embeddings using the xlm-clm checkpoints.
XLM without language embeddings
The following XLM models do not require language embeddings during inference:

FacebookAI/xlm-mlm-17-1280 (Masked language modeling, 17 languages)
FacebookAI/xlm-mlm-100-1280 (Masked language modeling, 100 languages)

These model
