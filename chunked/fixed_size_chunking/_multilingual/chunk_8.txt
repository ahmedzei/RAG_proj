lowing M2M100 models can be used for multilingual translation:

facebook/m2m100_418M (Translation)
facebook/m2m100_1.2B (Translation)

In this example, load the facebook/m2m100_418M checkpoint to translate from Chinese to English. You can set the source language in the tokenizer:

from transformers import M2M100ForConditionalGeneration, M2M100Tokenizer
en_text = "Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."
chinese_text = "不要插手巫師的事務, 因為他們是微妙的, 很快就會發怒."
tokenizer = M2M100
