model = model.to_bettertransformer()
You can return the original Transformers model with the [~PreTrainedModel.reverse_bettertransformer] method. You should use this before saving your model to use the canonical Transformers modeling:
py
model = model.reverse_bettertransformer()
model.save_pretrained("saved_model")
