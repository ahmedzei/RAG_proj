ombine optimizations
It is often possible to combine several of the optimization techniques described above to get the best inference performance possible for your model. For example, you can load a model in 4-bit, and then enable BetterTransformer with FlashAttention:

import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig
load model in 4-bit
quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16
)
tokenizer = AutoTok
