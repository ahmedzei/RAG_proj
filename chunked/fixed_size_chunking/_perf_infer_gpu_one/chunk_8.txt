and various batch sizes without padding tokens, the expected speedup is:

For a single forward pass on meta-llama/Llama-7b-hf with a sequence length of 4096 and various batch sizes without padding tokens, the expected speedup is:

For sequences with padding tokens (generating with padding tokens), you need to unpad/pad the input sequences to correctly compute the attention scores. With a relatively small sequence length, a single forward pass creates overhead leading to a small speedup (in the example below
