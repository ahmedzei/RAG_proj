GPU inference
GPUs are the standard choice of hardware for machine learning, unlike CPUs, because they are optimized for memory bandwidth and parallelism. To keep up with the larger sizes of modern models or to run these large models on existing and older hardware, there are several optimizations you can use to speed up GPU inference. In this guide, you'll learn how to use FlashAttention-2 (a more memory-efficient attention mechanism), BetterTransformer (a PyTorch native fastpath execution), and bitsandbyt
