orrect order of color channels,
applies OCR with tesseract to get words and normalized bounding boxes. In this tutorial, all of these defaults are exactly what we need.
Write a function that applies the default image processing to a batch of images and returns the results of OCR.

image_processor = processor.image_processor
def get_ocr_words_and_boxes(examples):
     images = [image.convert("RGB") for image in examples["image"]]
     encoded_inputs = image_processor(images)

     examples["image"] = encoded
