     eval_dataset=encoded_test_dataset,

trainer.train()

To add the final model to ğŸ¤— Hub, create a model card and call push_to_hub:

trainer.create_model_card()
trainer.push_to_hub()

Inference
Now that you have finetuned a LayoutLMv2 model, and uploaded it to the ğŸ¤— Hub, you can use it for inference. The simplest
way to try out your finetuned model for inference is to use it in a [Pipeline].
Let's take an example:

example = dataset
