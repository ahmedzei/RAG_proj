dictions by another model.
We'll also take the first of the answers from the set provided by the annotators. Alternatively, you can randomly sample it.

updated_dataset = dataset.map(lambda example: {"question": example["query"]["en"]}, remove_columns=["query"])
updated_dataset = updated_dataset.map(
     lambda example: {"answer": example["answers"][0]}, remove_columns=["answer", "answers"]
 )

Note that the LayoutLMv2 checkpoint that we use in this guide has been trained with max_position_embeddings = 512
