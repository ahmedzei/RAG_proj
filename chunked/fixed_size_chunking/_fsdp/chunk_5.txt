is and you don't need to change any code. You should select fsdp_auto_wrap_policy: TRANSFORMER_BASED_WRAP to wrap a Transformer layer and fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap to specify which layer to wrap (for example BertLayer).
Otherwise, you can choose a size-based wrapping policy where FSDP is applied to a layer if it exceeds a certain number of parameters. This is enabled by setting fsdp_wrap_policy: SIZE_BASED_WRAP and min_num_param to the desired size threshold.
