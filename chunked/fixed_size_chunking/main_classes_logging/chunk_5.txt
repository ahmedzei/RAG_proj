ansformers library. We leverage and adapt logging's captureWarning method to allow
management of these warning messages by the verbosity setters above.
What does that mean for developers of the library? We should respect the following heuristic:
- warnings should be favored for developers of the library and libraries dependent on transformers
- logging should be used for end-users of the library using it in every-day projects
See reference of the captureWarnings method below.
