All the methods of this logging module are documented below, the main ones are
[logging.get_verbosity] to get the current level of verbosity in the logger and
[logging.set_verbosity] to set the verbosity to the level of your choice. In order (from the least
verbose to the most verbose), those levels (with their corresponding int values in parenthesis) are:

transformers.logging.
