ke pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles are to avoid obstacles and collisions. Depth information is also helpful for constructing 3D representations from 2D images and can be used to create high-quality 3D representations of biological structures or buildings.
There are two approaches to depth estimation:

stereo: depths are estimated by comparing two images of the same image from slightly different angles
monocular: depths are estimated from a single image
