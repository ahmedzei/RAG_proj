y to represent an image as a matrix of pixel values. Each particular combination of pixel values describes the colors of an image. 
Two general ways computer vision tasks can be solved are:

Use convolutions to learn the hierarchical features of an image from low-level features to high-level abstract things.
Split an image into patches and use a Transformer to gradually learn how each image patch is related to each other to form an image. Unlike the bottom-up approach favored by a CNN, this is kind of like
