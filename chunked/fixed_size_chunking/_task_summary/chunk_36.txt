rticular problem. Image captioning is an example of a multimodal task where the model takes an image as input and outputs a sequence of text describing the image or some properties of the image. 
Although multimodal models work with different data types or modalities, internally, the preprocessing steps help the model convert all the data types into embeddings (vectors or list of numbers that holds meaningful information about the data). For a task like image captioning, the model learns relationships betwe
