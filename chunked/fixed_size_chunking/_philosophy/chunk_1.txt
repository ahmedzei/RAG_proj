-facing abstractions to learn, in fact, there are almost no abstractions,
    just three standard classes required to use each model: configuration,
    models, and a preprocessing class (tokenizer for NLP, image processor for vision, feature extractor for audio, and processor for multimodal inputs).

All of these classes can be initialized in a simple and unified way from pretrained instances by using a common
    from_pretrained() method which downloads (if needed), caches and
    loads the related class
