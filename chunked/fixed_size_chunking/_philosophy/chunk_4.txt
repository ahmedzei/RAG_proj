ure which reproduces a result provided by the official authors
    of said architecture.

The code is usually as close to the original code base as possible which means some PyTorch code may be not as
    pytorchic as it could be as a result of being converted TensorFlow code and vice versa.

A few other goals:

Expose the models' internals as consistently as possible:

We give access, using a single API, to the full hidden-states and attention weights.

The preprocessing classes and base model APIs are sta
