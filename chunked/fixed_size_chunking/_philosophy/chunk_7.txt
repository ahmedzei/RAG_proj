ch is part of the model).
Preprocessing classes convert the raw data into a format accepted by the model. A tokenizer stores the vocabulary for each model and provide methods for encoding and decoding strings in a list of token embedding indices to be fed to a model. Image processors preprocess vision inputs, feature extractors preprocess audio inputs, and a processor handles multimodal inputs.

All these classes can be instantiated from pretrained instances, saved locally, and shared on the Hub with three
