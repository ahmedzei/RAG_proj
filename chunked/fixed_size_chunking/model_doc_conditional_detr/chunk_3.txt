conditional DETR converges 6.7× faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10× faster for stronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101. Code is available at https://github.com/Atten4Vis/ConditionalDETR.

 Conditional DETR shows much faster convergence compared to the original DETR. Taken from the original paper.
