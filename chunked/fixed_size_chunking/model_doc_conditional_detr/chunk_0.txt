Conditional DETR
Overview
The Conditional DETR model was proposed in Conditional DETR for Fast Training Convergence by Depu Meng, Xiaokang Chen, Zejia Fan, Gang Zeng, Houqiang Li, Yuhui Yuan, Lei Sun, Jingdong Wang. Conditional DETR presents a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Conditional DETR converges 6.7× to 10× faster than DETR.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
The recently-developed DETR approach applies the transformer encoder and decoder architecture to objec
