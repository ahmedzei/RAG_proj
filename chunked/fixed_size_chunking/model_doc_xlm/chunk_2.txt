hine translation. On XNLI, our
approach pushes the state of the art by an absolute gain of 4.9% accuracy. On unsupervised machine translation, we
obtain 34.3 BLEU on WMT'16 German-English, improving the previous state of the art by more than 9 BLEU. On supervised
machine translation, we obtain a new state of the art of 38.5 BLEU on WMT'16 Romanian-English, outperforming the
previous best approach by more than 4 BLEU. Our code and pretrained models will be made publicly available.
