y of generative pretraining for English natural language understanding.
In this work, we extend this approach to multiple languages and show the effectiveness of cross-lingual pretraining. We
propose two methods to learn cross-lingual language models (XLMs): one unsupervised that only relies on monolingual
data, and one supervised that leverages parallel data with a new cross-lingual language model objective. We obtain
state-of-the-art results on cross-lingual classification, unsupervised and supervised mac
