Deformable DETR
Overview
The Deformable DETR model was proposed in Deformable DETR: Deformable Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection by Xizhou Zhu, Weijie Su, Lewei Lu, Bin Li, Xiaogang Wang, Jifeng Dai.
Deformable DETR mitigates the slow convergence issues and limited feature spatial resolution of the original DETR by leveraging a new deformable attention module which only attends to a small set of key sampling points around a reference.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
