can use an iterator, just like you would on a
dataset, since a webserver is basically a system that waits for requests and
treats them as they come in.
Usually webservers are multiplexed (multithreaded, async, etc..) to handle various
requests concurrently. Pipelines on the other hand (and mostly the underlying models)
are not really great for parallelism; they take up a lot of RAM, so it's best to give them all the available resources when they are running or it's a compute-intensive job.
We are going to s
