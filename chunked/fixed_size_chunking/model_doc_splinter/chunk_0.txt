Splinter
Overview
The Splinter model was proposed in Few-Shot Question Answering by Pretraining Span Selection by Ori Ram, Yuval Kirstain, Jonathan Berant, Amir Globerson, Omer Levy. Splinter
is an encoder-only transformer (similar to BERT) pretrained using the recurring span selection task on a large corpus
comprising Wikipedia and the Toronto Book Corpus.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
In several question answering benchmarks, pretrained models have reached human parity through fine-tuning
