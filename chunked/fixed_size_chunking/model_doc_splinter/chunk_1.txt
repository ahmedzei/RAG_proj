of 100,000 annotated questions and answers. We explore the more realistic few-shot setting, where only a few hundred
training examples are available, and observe that standard models perform poorly, highlighting the discrepancy between
current pretraining objectives and question answering. We propose a new pretraining scheme tailored for question

recurring spans but one, and ask t
