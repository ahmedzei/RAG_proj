e, in the run_qa.py script).
If you plan on using Splinter outside run_qa.py, please keep in mind the question token - it might be important for
  the success of your model, especially in a few-shot setting.
Please note there are two different checkpoints for each size of Splinter. Both are basically the same, except that
