The abstract from the paper is the following:
Pipelined NLP systems have largely been superseded by end-to-end neural modeling, yet nearly all commonly-used models
still require an explicit tokenization step. While recent tokenization approaches based on data-derived subword
lexicons are less brittle than manually engineered tokenizers, these techniques are not equally suited to all
languages, and the use o
