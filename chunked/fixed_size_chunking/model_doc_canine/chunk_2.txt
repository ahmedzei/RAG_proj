f any fixed vocabulary may limit a model's ability to adapt. In this paper, we present CANINE,
a neural encoder that operates directly on character sequences, without explicit tokenization or vocabulary, and a
pre-training strategy that operates either directly on characters or optionally uses subwords as a soft inductive bias.
To use its finer-grained input effectively and efficiently, CANINE combines downsampling, which reduces the input
sequence length, with a deep transformer stack, which encodes contex
