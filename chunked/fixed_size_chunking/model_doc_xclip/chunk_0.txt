X-CLIP
Overview
The X-CLIP model was proposed in Expanding Language-Image Pretrained Models for General Video Recognition by Bolin Ni, Houwen Peng, Minghao Chen, Songyang Zhang, Gaofeng Meng, Jianlong Fu, Shiming Xiang, Haibin Ling.
X-CLIP is a minimal extension of CLIP for video. The model consists of a text encoder, a cross-frame vision encoder, a multi-frame integration Transformer, and a video-specific prompt generator.
