UnivNet
Overview
The UnivNet model was proposed in UnivNet: A Neural Vocoder with Multi-Resolution Spectrogram Discriminators for High-Fidelity Waveform Generation by Won Jang, Dan Lim, Jaesam Yoon, Bongwan Kin, and Juntae Kim.
The UnivNet model is a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained to synthesize high fidelity speech waveforms. The UnivNet model shared in transformers is the generator, which maps a conditioning log-mel spectrogram and optional noise sequence to a speech waveform (e.g. a vocoder
