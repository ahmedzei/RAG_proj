[UnivNetModel] output through the [UnivNetFeatureExtractor.batch_decode] method, as shown in the usage example below.
Padding the end of each waveform with silence can reduce artifacts at the end of the generated audio sample. This can be done by supplying pad_end = True to [UnivNetFeatureExtractor.__call__]. See this issue for more details.

Usage Example:
thon
import torch
from scipy.io.wavfile import write
from datasets import Audio, load_dataset
from transformers import UnivNetFeatureExtractor, UnivNetM
