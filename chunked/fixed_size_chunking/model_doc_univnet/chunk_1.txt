). Only the generator is required for inference. The discriminator used to train the generator is not implemented.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Most neural vocoders employ band-limited mel-spectrograms to generate waveforms. If full-band spectral features are used as the input, the vocoder can be provided with as much acoustic information as possible. However, in some models employing full-band mel-spectrograms, an over-smoothing problem occurs as part of which non-sharp spectrograms are ge
