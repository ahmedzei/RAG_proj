nerated. To address this problem, we propose UnivNet, a neural vocoder that synthesizes high-fidelity waveforms in real time. Inspired by works in the field of voice activity detection, we added a multi-resolution spectrogram discriminator that employs multiple linear spectrogram magnitudes computed using various parameter sets. Using full-band mel-spectrograms as input, we expect to generate high-resolution signals by adding a discriminator that employs spectrograms of multiple resolutions as the input. In
