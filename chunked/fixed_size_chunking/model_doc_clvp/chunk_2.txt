rded to the diffusion model.
The use of the [ClvpModelForConditionalGeneration.generate()] method is strongly recommended for tortoise usage.
Note that the CLVP model expects the audio to be sampled at 22.05 kHz contrary to other audio models which expects 16 kHz. 

Brief Explanation:

The [ClvpTokenizer] tokenizes the text input, and the [ClvpFeatureExtractor] extracts the log mel-spectrogram from the desired audio.
[ClvpConditioningEncoder] takes those text tokens and audio representations and converts th
