em into embeddings conditioned on the text and audio.
The [ClvpForCausalLM] uses those embeddings to generate multiple speech candidates.
Each speech candidate is passed through the speech encoder ([ClvpEncoder]) which converts them into a vector representation, and the text encoder ([ClvpEncoder]) converts the text tokens into the same latent space. 
At the end, we compare each speech vector with the text vector to see which speech vector is most similar to the text vector.
