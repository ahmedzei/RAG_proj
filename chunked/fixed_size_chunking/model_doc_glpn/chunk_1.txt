depth estimation. The proposed decoder shows better performance than the previously proposed decoders, with considerably
less computational complexity.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Depth estimation from a single image is an important task that can be applied to various fields in computer vision, and has grown rapidly with the development of convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel structure and training strategy for monocular depth estimation to further improve the p
