The [pipeline] can also iterate over an entire dataset for any task you like. For this example, let's choose automatic speech recognition as our task:

Load an audio dataset (see the ðŸ¤— Datasets Quick Start for more details) you'd like to iterate over. For example, load the MInDS-14 dataset:

from datasets import load_dataset, Audio
