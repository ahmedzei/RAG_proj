et as a tf.data.Dataset so you can start training right away with Keras' compile and fit methods.

You'll start with a [TFPreTrainedModel] or a tf.keras.Model:

from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification
model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")
   

Load a preprocessing class like a tokenizer, image processor, feature extractor, or processor:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilb
