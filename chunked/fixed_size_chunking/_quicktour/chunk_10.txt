You need to make sure the sampling rate of the dataset matches the sampling 
rate facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h was trained on:

dataset = dataset.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=speech_recognizer.feature_extractor.sampling_rate))

The audio files are automatically loaded and resampled when calling the "audio" column.
Extract the raw waveform arrays from the first 4 samples and pass it as a list to the pip
