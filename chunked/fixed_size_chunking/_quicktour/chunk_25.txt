All ðŸ¤— Transformers models (PyTorch or TensorFlow) output the tensors before the final activation
function (like softmax) because the final activation function is often fused with the loss. Model outputs are special dataclasses so their attributes are autocompleted in an IDE. The model outputs behave like a tuple or a dictionary (you can index with an integer, a slice or a strin
