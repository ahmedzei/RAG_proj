 you'd like a model capable of handling French text, use the tags on the Hub to filter for an appropriate model. The top filtered result returns a multilingual BERT model finetuned for sentiment analysis you can use for French text:

model_name = "nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment"

Use [AutoModelForSequenceClassification] and [AutoTokenizer] to load the pretrained model and it's associated tokenizer (more on an AutoClass in the next section):

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoMode
