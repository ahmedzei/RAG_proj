t"
pt_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

See the task summary for tasks supported by an [AutoModel] class.

Now pass your preprocessed batch of inputs directly to the model. You just have to unpack the dictionary by adding **:

pt_outputs = pt_model(**pt_batch)

The model outputs the final activations in the logits attribute. Apply the softmax function to the logits to retrieve the probabilities:

from torch import nn
pt_predictions = nn.functional.softmax(pt_outputs.log
