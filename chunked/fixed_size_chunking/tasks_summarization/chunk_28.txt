need to specify one unless you want to:

import tensorflow as tf
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)  # No loss argument!

The last two things to setup before you start training is to compute the ROUGE score from the predictions, and provide a way to push your model to the Hub. Both are done by using Keras callbacks.
Pass your compute_metrics function to [~transformers.KerasMetricCallback]:

from transformers.keras_callbacks import KerasMetricCallback
metric_callback = KerasMetricCallback(metric_fn=compute_m
