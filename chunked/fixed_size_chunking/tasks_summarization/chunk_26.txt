ras, take a look at the basic tutorial here!

To finetune a model in TensorFlow, start by setting up an optimizer function, learning rate schedule, and some training hyperparameters:

from transformers import create_optimizer, AdamWeightDecay
optimizer = AdamWeightDecay(learning_rate=2e-5, weight_decay_rate=0.01)

Then you can load T5 with [TFAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM]:

from transformers import TFAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
model = TFAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

Convert your datasets to the tf.
