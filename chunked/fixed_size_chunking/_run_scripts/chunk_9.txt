Run a script on a TPU

Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are specifically designed to accelerate performance. PyTorch supports TPUs with the XLA deep learning compiler (see here for more details). To use a TPU, launch the xla_spawn.py script and use the num_cores argument to set the number of TPU cores you want to use.

python xla_spawn.py --num_cores 8 \

    --model_name_or_path google-t5/t5-small \
