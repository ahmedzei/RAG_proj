train_file and validation_file specify the path to your training and validation files.
text_column is the input text to summarize.
summary_column is the target text to output.

python examples/pytorch/summarization/run_summarization.py \
    --model_name_or_path google-t5/t5-small \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
