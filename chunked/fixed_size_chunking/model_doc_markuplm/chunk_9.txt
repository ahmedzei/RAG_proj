Use case 2: web page classification (training, inference) + token classification (inference), parse_html=False
In case one already has obtained all nodes and xpaths, one doesn't need the feature extractor. In that case, one should
provide the nodes and corresponding xpaths themselves to the processor, and make sure to set parse_html to False.
