and it will create the inputs expected by the model. Internally, the processor first uses
[MarkupLMFeatureExtractor] to get a list of nodes and corresponding xpaths. The nodes and

to token-level input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids, xpath_subs_seq, xpath_tags_seq.
Optionally, one can provide node labels to the processor, which are turned into token-level labels.
[MarkupLMFeatureExtractor] uses Beautiful Sou
