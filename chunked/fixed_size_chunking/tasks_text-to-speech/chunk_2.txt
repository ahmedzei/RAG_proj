 Bark and other pretrained TTS models can do, refer to our 
Audio course. 
If you are looking to fine-tune a TTS model, the only text-to-speech models currently available in ðŸ¤— Transformers 
are SpeechT5 and FastSpeech2Conformer, though more will be added in the future. SpeechT5 is pre-trained on a combination of speech-to-text and text-to-speech data, allowing it to learn a unified space of hidden representations shared by both text and speech. This means that the same pre-trained model can be fine-tuned fo
