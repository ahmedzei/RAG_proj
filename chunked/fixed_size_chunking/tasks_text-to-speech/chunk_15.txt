aset have fewer than 100 examples, while 
around ten speakers have more than 500 examples. To improve training efficiency and balance the dataset, we can limit 
the data to speakers with between 100 and 400 examples. 

def select_speaker(speaker_id):
     return 100 <= speaker_counts[speaker_id] <= 400
dataset = dataset.filter(select_speaker, input_columns=["speaker_id"])

Let's check how many speakers remain: 

len(set(dataset["speaker_id"]))
42

Let's see how many examples are left: 

len(dataset)
9973
