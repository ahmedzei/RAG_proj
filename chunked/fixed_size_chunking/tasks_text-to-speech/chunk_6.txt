features that make it beneficial for ASR, such as excessive background noise, are 
typically undesirable in TTS. However, finding top-quality, multilingual, and multi-speaker TTS datasets can be quite 
challenging.
Let's load the data:

from datasets import load_dataset, Audio
dataset = load_dataset("facebook/voxpopuli", "nl", split="train")
len(dataset)
20968

20968 examples should be sufficient for fine-tuning. SpeechT5 expects audio data to have a sampling rate of 16 kHz, so 
make sure the examples in th
