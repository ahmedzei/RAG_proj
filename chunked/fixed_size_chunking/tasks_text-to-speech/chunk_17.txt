fferentiate between multiple speakers, you'll need to create a speaker embedding for each example. 
The speaker embedding is an additional input into the model that captures a particular speaker's voice characteristics.
To generate these speaker embeddings, use the pre-trained spkrec-xvect-voxceleb 
model from SpeechBrain. 
Create a function create_speaker_embedding() that takes an input audio waveform and outputs a 512-element vector 
containing the corresponding speaker embedding.
