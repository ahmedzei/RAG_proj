e dataset meet this requirement:
py
dataset = dataset.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=16000))
Preprocess the data
Let's begin by defining the model checkpoint to use and loading the appropriate processor: 

from transformers import SpeechT5Processor
checkpoint = "microsoft/speecht5_tts"
processor = SpeechT5Processor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

Text cleanup for SpeechT5 tokenization
Start by cleaning up the text data. You'll need the tokenizer part of the processor to process the text:

tokenizer =
