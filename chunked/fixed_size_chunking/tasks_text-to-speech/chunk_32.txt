nstantiate the Trainer object  and pass the model, dataset, and data collator to it.

from transformers import Seq2SeqTrainer
trainer = Seq2SeqTrainer(
     args=training_args,
     model=model,
     train_dataset=dataset["train"],
     eval_dataset=dataset["test"],
     data_collator=data_collator,
     tokenizer=processor,
 )

And with that, you're ready to start training! Training will take several hours. Depending on your GPU, 
it is possible that you will encounter a CUDA "out-of-memory" error when you
