-trained on masked image modeling. Note that this won't include the language modeling head on top, used to predict visual tokens.
To include the head, you can load the weights into a BeitForMaskedImageModeling model, like so:
thon
from transformers import BeitForMaskedImageModeling
model = BeitForMaskedImageModeling.from_pretrained("microsoft/dit-base")

You can also load a fine-tuned model from the hub, like so:
thon
from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification
model = AutoModelForImageClassifi
