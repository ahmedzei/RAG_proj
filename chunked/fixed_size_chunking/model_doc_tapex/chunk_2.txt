veraging large-scale unstructured textual data. However, it is
still a challenge to apply pre-training on structured tabular data due to the absence of large-scale high-quality tabular data. In this paper, we
propose TAPEX to show that table pre-training can be achieved by learning a neural SQL executor over a synthetic corpus, which is obtained by automatically
synthesizing executable SQL queries and their execution outputs. TAPEX addresses the data scarcity challenge via guiding the language model to mimi
