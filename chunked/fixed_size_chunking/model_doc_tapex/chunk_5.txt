earized table. The linearized table has the following format: 
  col: col1 | col2 | col 3 row 1 : val1 | val2 | val3 row 2 : .
TAPEX has its own tokenizer, that allows to prepare all data for the model easily. One can pass Pandas DataFrames and strings to the tokenizer,
  and it will automatically create the input_ids and attention_mask (as shown in the usage examples below). 

Usage: inference
Below, we illustrate how to use TAPEX for table question answering. As one can see, one can directly plug in the w
