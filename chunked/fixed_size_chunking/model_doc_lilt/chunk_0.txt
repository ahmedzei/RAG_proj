LiLT
Overview
The LiLT model was proposed in LiLT: A Simple yet Effective Language-Independent Layout Transformer for Structured Document Understanding by Jiapeng Wang, Lianwen Jin, Kai Ding.
LiLT allows to combine any pre-trained RoBERTa text encoder with a lightweight Layout Transformer, to enable LayoutLM-like document understanding for many
languages.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Structured document understanding has attracted considerable attention and made significant progress recent
