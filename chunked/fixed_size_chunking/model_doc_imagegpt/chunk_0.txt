ImageGPT
Overview
The ImageGPT model was proposed in Generative Pretraining from Pixels by Mark
Chen, Alec Radford, Rewon Child, Jeffrey Wu, Heewoo Jun, David Luan, Ilya Sutskever. ImageGPT (iGPT) is a GPT-2-like
model trained to predict the next pixel value, allowing for both unconditional and conditional image generation.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Inspired by progress in unsupervised representation learning for natural language, we examine whether similar models
can learn useful repre
