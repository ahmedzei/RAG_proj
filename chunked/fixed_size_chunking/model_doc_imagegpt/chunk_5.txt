of any labels), ImageGPT produces fairly
  performant image features useful for downstream tasks, such as image classification. The authors showed that the
  features in the middle of the network are the most performant, and can be used as-is to train a linear model (such as
  a sklearn logistic regression model for example). This is also referred to as "linear probing". Features can be
  easily obtained by first forwarding the image through the model, then specifying output_hidden_states=True, and
  then a
