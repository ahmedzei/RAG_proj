class accordingly. Refer to the data API documentation to learn more. Also, if your dataset follows a similar structure (as shown above), then using the pytorchvideo.data.Ucf101() should work just fine. 
You can access the num_videos argument to know the number of videos in the dataset.

print(train_dataset.num_videos, val_dataset.num_videos, test_dataset.num_videos)

(300, 30, 75)
