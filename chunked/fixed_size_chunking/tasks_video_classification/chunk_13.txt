entation of PyTorchVideo.  
Use the image_processor associated with the pre-trained model to obtain the following information:

Image mean and standard deviation with which the video frame pixels will be normalized.
Spatial resolution to which the video frames will be resized.

Start by defining some constants.

mean = image_processor.image_mean
std = image_processor.image_std
if "shortest_edge" in image_processor.size:
     height = width = image_processor.size["shortest_edge"]
else:
     height = image_pr
