ts are self-explanatory, but one that is quite important here is remove_unused_columns=False. This one will drop any features not used by the model's call function. By default it's True because usually it's ideal to drop unused feature columns, making it easier to unpack inputs into the model's call function. But, in this case, you need the unused features ('video' in particular) in order to create pixel_values (which is a mandatory key our model expects in its inputs).
