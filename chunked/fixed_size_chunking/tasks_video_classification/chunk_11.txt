ing considerable domain overlap. You can check out this checkpoint which was obtained by fine-tuning MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics.  
Prepare the datasets for training
For preprocessing the videos, you will leverage the PyTorchVideo library. Start by importing the dependencies we need. 
 

import pytorchvideo.data
from pytorchvideo.transforms import (
     ApplyTransformToKey,
     Normalize,
     RandomShortSideScale,
     RemoveKey,
     ShortSideScale,
     UniformTemporalSubsample,
 )
