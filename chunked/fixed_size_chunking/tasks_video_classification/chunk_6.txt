Load a model to fine-tune
Instantiate a video classification model from a pretrained checkpoint and its associated image processor. The model's encoder comes with pre-trained parameters, and the classification head is randomly initialized. The image processor will come in handy when writing the preprocessing pipeline for our dataset.
