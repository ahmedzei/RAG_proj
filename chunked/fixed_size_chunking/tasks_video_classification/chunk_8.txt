n initializing VideoMAEForVideoClassification: [, 'decoder.decoder_layers.1.attention.output.dense.bias', 'decoder.decoder_layers.2.attention.attention.key.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing VideoMAEForVideoClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing VideoMAEForVideoClassification from the checkpoint
