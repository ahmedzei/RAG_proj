ollate_fn, which will be used to batch examples together. Each batch consists of 2 keys, namely pixel_values and labels.
 

def collate_fn(examples):
     # permute to (num_frames, num_channels, height, width)
     pixel_values = torch.stack(
         [example["video"].permute(1, 0, 2, 3) for example in examples]
     )
     labels = torch.tensor([example["label"] for example in examples])
     return {"pixel_values": pixel_values, "labels": labels}

Then you just pass all of this along with the datasets to
