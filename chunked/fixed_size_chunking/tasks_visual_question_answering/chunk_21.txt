and longer training, you'll get far better results!
You can also manually replicate the results of the pipeline if you'd like:
1. Take an image and a question, prepare them for the model using the processor from your model.
2. Forward the result or preprocessing through the model.
3. From the logits, get the most likely answer's id, and find the actual answer in the id2label.

processor = ViltProcessor.from_pretrained("MariaK/vilt_finetuned_200")
image = Image.open(example['image_id'])
question = example['q
