"He is looking at the crowd" 

As you can see, the model recognized the crowd, and the direction of the face (looking down), however, it seems to miss 
the fact the crowd is behind the skater. Still, in cases where acquiring human-annotated datasets is not feasible, this 
approach can quickly produce useful results.
