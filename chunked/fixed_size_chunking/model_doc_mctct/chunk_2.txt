Semi-supervised learning through pseudo-labeling has become a staple of state-of-the-art monolingual
speech recognition systems. In this work, we extend pseudo-labeling to massively multilingual speech
recognition with 60 languages. We propose a simple pseudo-labeling recipe that works well even
with low-resource languages: train a supervised multilingual model, fine-tune it with semi-supervised
learning on a target language, generate pseudo-labels for that language, and train a final model usi
