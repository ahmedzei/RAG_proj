pseudo-labels for all languages, either from scratch or by fine-tuning. Experiments on the labeled
Common Voice and unlabeled VoxPopuli datasets show that our recipe can yield a model with better
performance for many languages that also transfers well to LibriSpeech.
This model was contributed by cwkeam. The original code can be found here.
