ransformer encoder, with a CTC head over 8065 character labels and a language identification head over 60 language ID labels. It is trained on Common Voice (version 6.1, December 2020 release) and VoxPopuli. After training on Common Voice and VoxPopuli, the model is trained on Common Voice only. The labels are unnormalized character-level transcripts (punctuation and capitalization are not removed). The model takes as input Mel filterbank features from a 16Khz audio signal.
