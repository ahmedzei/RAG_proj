ates of the same shape (you can consider
these as image features). Next, so-called object queries are sent through the decoder. This is a tensor of shape
(batch_size, num_queries, d_model), with num_queries typically set to 100 and initialized with zeros.
These input embeddings are learnt positional encodings that the authors refer to as object queries, and similarly to
the encoder, they are added to the input of each attention layer. Each object query will look for a particular object
in the image. The dec
