DETR can be naturally extended to perform panoptic segmentation (which unifies semantic segmentation and instance
segmentation). [~transformers.DetrForSegmentation] adds a segmentation mask head on top of
[~transformers.DetrForObjectDetection]. The mask head can be trained either jointly, or in a two steps process,
where one first trains a [~transformers.DetrForObjectDetection] model to detect bounding boxes around both
"things" (instances) and "stuff" (background things
