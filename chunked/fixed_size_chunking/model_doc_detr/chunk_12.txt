  absolute position embeddings. By default, the parameter position_embedding_type of
  [~transformers.DetrConfig] is set to "sine".
During training, the authors of DETR did find it helpful to use auxiliary losses in the decoder, especially to help
  the model output the correct number of objects of each class. If you set the parameter auxiliary_loss of
