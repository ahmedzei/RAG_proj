each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N
(so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a "no object" as class and "no bounding box" as
bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to find
an optimal one-to-one mapping of each of the N queries to each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for
the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the
bounding boxes) are used to o
