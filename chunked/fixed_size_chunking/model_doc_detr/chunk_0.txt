DETR
Overview
The DETR model was proposed in End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers by
Nicolas Carion, Francisco Massa, Gabriel Synnaeve, Nicolas Usunier, Alexander Kirillov and Sergey Zagoruyko. DETR
consists of a convolutional backbone followed by an encoder-decoder Transformer which can be trained end-to-end for
object detection. It greatly simplifies a lot of the complexity of models like Faster-R-CNN and Mask-R-CNN, which use
things like region proposals, non-maximum suppression procedure and a
