nchor generation. Moreover, DETR can also be
naturally extended to perform panoptic segmentation, by simply adding a mask head on top of the decoder outputs.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the
detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression
procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge ab
