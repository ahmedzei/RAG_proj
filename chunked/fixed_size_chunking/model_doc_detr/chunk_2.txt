out the task. The main ingredients of the
new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via
bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries,
DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of
predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many
othe
