r modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and
highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily
generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive
baselines.
