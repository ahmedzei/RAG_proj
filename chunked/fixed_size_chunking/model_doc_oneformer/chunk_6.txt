o a single instance to both prepare the images and encode the task inputs.
To get the final segmentation, depending on the task, you can call [~OneFormerProcessor.post_process_semantic_segmentation] or [~OneFormerImageProcessor.post_process_instance_segmentation] or [~OneFormerImageProcessor.post_process_panoptic_segmentation]. All three tasks can be solved using [OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation] output, panoptic segmentation accepts an optional label_ids_to_fuse argument to fuse instances of the target o
