ted environment across multiple nodes, then one should update the
  get_num_masks function inside in the OneFormerLoss class of modeling_oneformer.py. When training on multiple nodes, this should be
  set to the average number of target masks across all nodes, as can be seen in the original implementation here.
One can use [OneFormerProcessor] to prepare input images and task inputs for the model and optional targets for the model. [OneformerProcessor] wraps [OneFormerImageProcessor] and [CLIPTokenizer] int
