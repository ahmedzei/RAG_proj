OneFormer
Overview
The OneFormer model was proposed in OneFormer: One Transformer to Rule Universal Image Segmentation by Jitesh Jain, Jiachen Li, MangTik Chiu, Ali Hassani, Nikita Orlov, Humphrey Shi. OneFormer is a universal image segmentation framework that can be trained on a single panoptic dataset to perform semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks. OneFormer uses a task token to condition the model on the task in focus, making the architecture task-guided for training, and task-dynamic fo
