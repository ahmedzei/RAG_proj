Overview
The XLNet model was proposed in XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding by Zhilin Yang, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Ruslan Salakhutdinov,
Quoc V. Le. XLnet is an extension of the Transformer-XL model pre-trained using an autoregressive method to learn
bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the input sequence factorization
order.
