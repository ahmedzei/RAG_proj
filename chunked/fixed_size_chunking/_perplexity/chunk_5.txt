or
approximation of the fully-factorized perplexity and will typically yield a higher (worse) PPL because the model will
have less context at most of the prediction steps.
Instead, the PPL of fixed-length models should be evaluated with a sliding-window strategy. This involves repeatedly
sliding the context window so that the model has more context when making each prediction.

This is a closer approximation to the true decomposition of the sequence probability and will typically yield a more
favorable scor
