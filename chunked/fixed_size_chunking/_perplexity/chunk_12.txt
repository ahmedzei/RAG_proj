When we run the above with stride = 1024, i.e. no overlap, the resulting PPL is 19.44, which is about the same
as the 19.93 reported in the GPT-2 paper. By using stride = 512 and thereby employing our striding window
strategy, this jumps down to 16.45. This is not only a more favorable score, but is calculated in a way that is
closer to the true autoregressive decomposition of a sequence likelihood.
