ned uni-modal encoders into the top cross-modal encoder.
Both approaches potentially restrict vision-language representation learning and limit model performance. In this paper, we propose BRIDGETOWER, which introduces multiple bridge layers that build a connection between the top layers of uni-modal encoders and each layer of the crossmodal encoder.
This enables effective bottom-up cross-modal alignment and fusion between visual and textual representations of different semantic levels of pre-trained uni-mo
