Overview
The BARTpho model was proposed in BARTpho: Pre-trained Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Vietnamese by Nguyen Luong Tran, Duong Minh Le and Dat Quoc Nguyen.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We present BARTpho with two versions -- BARTpho_word and BARTpho_syllable -- the first public large-scale monolingual
