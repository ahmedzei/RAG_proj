nds for Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional
representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result,
the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models
for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific
arch
