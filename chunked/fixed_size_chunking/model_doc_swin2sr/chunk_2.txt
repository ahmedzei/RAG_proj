mpressive performance on these tasks.
In this paper, we explore the novel Swin Transformer V2, to improve SwinIR for image super-resolution, and in particular, the compressed input scenario. Using this method we can tackle the major issues in training transformer vision models, such as training instability, resolution gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, and hunger on data. We conduct experiments on three representative tasks: JPEG compression artifacts removal, image super-resolution (classical and l
