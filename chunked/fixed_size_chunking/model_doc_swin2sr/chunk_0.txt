Swin2SR
Overview
The Swin2SR model was proposed in Swin2SR: SwinV2 Transformer for Compressed Image Super-Resolution and Restoration by Marcos V. Conde, Ui-Jin Choi, Maxime Burchi, Radu Timofte.
Swin2R improves the SwinIR model by incorporating Swin Transformer v2 layers which mitigates issues such as training instability, resolution gaps between pre-training
and fine-tuning, and hunger on data.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
