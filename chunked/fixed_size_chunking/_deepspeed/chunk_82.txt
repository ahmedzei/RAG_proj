u have an 80GB GPU -
you will need 2-4 gpus. And then you can adapt the script to handle more gpus if you want to
process multiple inputs at once.

The provided deepspeed config also activates CPU memory offloading, so chances are that if you
have a lot of available CPU memory and you don't mind a slowdown you should be able to load a
model that doesn't normally fit into a single GPU. If you have enough GPU memory the program will
run faster if you don't want offload to CPU - so disable that section then.
