g such that a modern NVMe can fit an even larger total memory pool than is available to your training process. ZeRO-Infinity requires ZeRO-3.
Depending on the CPU and/or NVMe memory available, you can offload both the optimizer states and parameters, just one of them, or none. You should also make sure the nvme_path is pointing to an NVMe device, because while it still works with a normal hard drive or solid state drive, it'll be significantly slower. With a modern NVMe, you can expect peak transfer speeds
