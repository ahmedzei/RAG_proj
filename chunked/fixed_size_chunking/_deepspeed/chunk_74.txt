he DeepSpeed checkpoint (ZeRO-2 or ZeRO-3) subfolder global_step1, run the following command to create and consolidate the full fp32 weights from multiple GPUs into a single pytorch_model.bin file. The script automatically discovers the subfolder containing the checkpoint.
py
python zero_to_fp32.py . pytorch_model.bin

Run python zero_to_fp32.py -h for more usage details. The script requires 2x the general RAM of the final fp32 weights.

ZeRO Inference
ZeRO Inference places the model weights in CPU or NVMe
