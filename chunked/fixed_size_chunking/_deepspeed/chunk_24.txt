of CPU memory for extremely large models. sub_group_size can be left to its default value if you aren't using NVMe offload, but you may want to change it if you:

Run into an OOM error during the optimizer step. In this case, reduce sub_group_size to reduce memory usage of the temporary buffers.
The optimizer step is taking a really long time. In this case, increase sub_group_size to improve bandwidth utilization as a result of increased data buffers.
