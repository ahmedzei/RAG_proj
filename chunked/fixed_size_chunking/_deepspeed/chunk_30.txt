tensor([1.0], device="cuda:0", dtype=torch.float16, requires_grad=True)

For more information about initializing large models with ZeRO-3 and accessing the parameters, take a look at the Constructing Massive Models and Gathering Parameters guides.

NVMe configuration
ZeRO-Infinity allows offloading model states to the CPU and/or NVMe to save even more memory. Smart partitioning and tiling algorithms allow each GPU to send and receive very small amounts of data during offloadin
