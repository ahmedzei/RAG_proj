d in the context of the same application. You'll need to initialize the DeepSpeed engine again since model.load_state_dict(state_dict) removes all the DeepSpeed magic from it. Only use this at the very end of training.

You can also extract and load the state_dict of the fp32 weights:

from deepspeed.utils.zero_to_fp32 import get_fp32_state_dict_from_zero_checkpoint
state_dict = get_fp32_state_dict_from_zero_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir)  # already on cpu
model = model.cpu()
model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
