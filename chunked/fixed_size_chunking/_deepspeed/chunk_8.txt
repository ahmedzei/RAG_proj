(starting with the most memory efficient or fastest) to discover the appropriate balance between speed and memory usage.
A general process you can use is (start with batch size of 1):

enable gradient checkpointing
try ZeRO-2
try ZeRO-2 and offload the optimizer
try ZeRO-3
try ZeRO-3 and offload parameters to the CPU
try ZeRO-3 and offload parameters and the optimizer to the CPU
try lowering various default values like a narrower search beam if you're using the [~GenerationMixin.generate] method
try mixed h
