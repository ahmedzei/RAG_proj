Use tokenizers from ðŸ¤— Tokenizers
The [PreTrainedTokenizerFast] depends on the ðŸ¤— Tokenizers library. The tokenizers obtained from the ðŸ¤— Tokenizers library can be
loaded very simply into ðŸ¤— Transformers.
Before getting in the specifics, let's first start by creating a dummy tokenizer in a few lines:
thon

from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from tokenizers.models import BPE
from tokenizers.trainers import BpeTrainer
from tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import Whitespace
tokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
