rithm (termed MGP-STR) is able to push the performance envelop of STR to an even higher level. Specifically, it achieves an average recognition accuracy of 93.35% on standard benchmarks.

 MGP-STR architecture. Taken from the original paper. 
MGP-STR is trained on two synthetic datasets MJSynth (MJ) and SynthText (ST) without fine-tuning on other datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art results on six standard Latin scene text benchmarks, including 3 regular text datasets (IC13, SVT, IIIT) and 3 irregular one
