MGP-STR
Overview
The MGP-STR model was proposed in Multi-Granularity Prediction for Scene Text Recognition by Peng Wang, Cheng Da, and Cong Yao. MGP-STR is a conceptually simple yet powerful vision Scene Text Recognition (STR) model, which is built upon the Vision Transformer (ViT). To integrate linguistic knowledge, Multi-Granularity Prediction (MGP) strategy is proposed to inject information from the language modality into the model in an implicit way.
