text recognition (STR) has been an active research topic in computer vision for years. To tackle this challenging problem, numerous innovative methods have been successively proposed and incorporating linguistic knowledge into STR models has recently become a prominent trend. In this work, we first draw inspiration from the recent progress in Vision Transformer (ViT) to construct a conceptually simple yet powerful vision STR model, which is built upon ViT and outperforms previous state-of-the-art models for
