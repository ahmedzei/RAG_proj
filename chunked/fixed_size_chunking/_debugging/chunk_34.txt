 huge number of frames dumped - as many as there were forward calls in your model, so it may or may
not what you want, but sometimes it can be easier to use for debugging purposes than a normal debugger. For example, if
a problem starts happening at batch number 150. So you can dump traces for batches 149 and 150 and compare where
numbers started to diverge.
You can also specify the batch number after which to stop the training, with:
python
debug_overflow = DebugUnderflowOverflow(model, trace_batch_nums=[1
