62.7K, which is very close to fp16's top limit of 64K. In the next frame we have Dropout which renormalizes
the weights, after it zeroed some of the elements, which pushes the absolute max value to more than 64K, and we get an
overflow (inf).
As you can see it's the previous frames that we need to look into when the numbers start going into very large for fp16
numbers.
Let's match the report to the code from models/t5/modeling_t5.py:
