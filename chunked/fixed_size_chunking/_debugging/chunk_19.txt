tput has been trimmed in the middle for brevity.
The second column shows the value of the absolute largest element, so if you have a closer look at the last few frames,
the inputs and outputs were in the range of 1e4. So when this training was done under fp16 mixed precision the very
last step overflowed (since under fp16 the largest number before inf is 64e3). To avoid overflows under
fp16 the activations must remain way below 1e4, because 1e4 * 1e4 = 1e8 so any matrix multiplication with
large activations
