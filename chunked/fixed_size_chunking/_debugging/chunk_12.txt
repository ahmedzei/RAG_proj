For example to test how 2 GPUs interact do:

python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node 2 --nnodes 1 torch-distributed-gpu-test.py
If both processes can talk to each and allocate GPU memory each will print an OK status.
For more GPUs or nodes adjust the arguments in the script.
You will find a lot more details inside the diagnostics script and even a recipe to how you could run it in a SLURM environment.
An additional level of debug is to add N
