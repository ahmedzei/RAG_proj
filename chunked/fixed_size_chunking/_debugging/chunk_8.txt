ify your GPU's architecture by editing the TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST variable (find a complete list of NVIDIA GPUs and their corresponding architectures on this page). To check the PyTorch version that corresponds to your architecture, run the following command:

python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.get_arch_list())"
Find the architecture for a GPU with the following command:

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.get_device_capability())"

To find the architecture for GPU 0:
