Specific batch absolute min and max value tracing
The same debugging class can be used for per-batch tracing with the underflow/overflow detection feature turned off.
Let's say you want to watch the absolute min and max values for all the ingredients of each forward call of a given
batch, and only do that for batches 1 and 3. Then you instantiate this class as:
python
debug_overflow = DebugUnderflowOverflow(model, trace_batch_nums=[1, 3])
And now full batches 1 and 3 will be t
