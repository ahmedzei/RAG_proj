    hidden_states = self.dropout(hidden_states)
    hidden_states = self.wo(hidden_states)
    return hidden_states

Now it's easy to see the dropout call, and all the previous calls as well.
Since the detection is happening in a forward hook, these reports are printed immediately after each forward
returns.
Going back to the full report, to act on it and to fix the problem, we need to go a few frames up where the numbers
