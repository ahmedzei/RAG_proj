epresentation learning on patched time series. Our model draws inspiration from the success of MLP-Mixer models in computer vision. We demonstrate the challenges involved in adapting Vision MLP-Mixer for time series and introduce empirically validated components to enhance accuracy. This includes a novel design paradigm of attaching online reconciliation heads to the MLP-Mixer backbone, for explicitly modeling the time-series properties such as hierarchy and channel-correlations. We also propose a Hybrid ch
