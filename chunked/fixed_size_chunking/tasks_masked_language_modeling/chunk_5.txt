ls (also known as an unsupervised task) because the next word is the label.
Preprocess

For masked language modeling, the next step is to load a DistilRoBERTa tokenizer to process the text subfield:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilroberta-base")

You'll notice from the example above, the text field is actually nested inside answers. This means you'll need to extract the text subfield from its nested structure with the flatten method:
