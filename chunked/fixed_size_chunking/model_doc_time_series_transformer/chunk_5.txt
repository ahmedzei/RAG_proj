hich you have the time-series values (like the ResNet embedding of a "shoe" picture,
if your time-series is about the sales of shoes).
Note that these features need to be known for ALL data points (also those in the future).

The model is trained using "teacher-forcing", similar to how a Transformer is trained for machine translation. This means that, during training, one shifts the
future_values one position to the right as input to the decoder, prepended by the last value of past_values. At each time step
