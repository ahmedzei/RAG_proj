hEncoderDecoderModel checkpoint and perform inference.
To load fine-tuned checkpoints of the SpeechEncoderDecoderModel class, [SpeechEncoderDecoderModel] provides the from_pretrained() method just like any other model architecture in Transformers.
To perform inference, one uses the [generate] method, which allows to autoregressively generate text. This method supports various forms of decoding, such as greedy, beam search and multinomial sampling.
