Speech Encoder Decoder Models
The [SpeechEncoderDecoderModel] can be used to initialize a speech-to-text model
with any pretrained speech autoencoding model as the encoder (e.g. Wav2Vec2, Hubert) and any pretrained autoregressive model as the decoder.
The effectiveness of initializing speech-sequence-to-text-sequence models with pretrained checkpoints for speech
recognition and speech translation has e.g. been shown in Large-Scale Self- and Semi-Supervised Learning for Speech
