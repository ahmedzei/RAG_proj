d be serializable. You can save the quantized weights locally or push them to the Hub.
Make sure the package that contains the quantization kernels/primitive is stable (no frequent breaking changes).

For some quantization methods, they may require "pre-quantizing" the models through data calibration (e.g., AWQ). In this case, we prefer to only support inference in Transformers and let the third-party library maintained by the ML community deal with the model quantization itself.
