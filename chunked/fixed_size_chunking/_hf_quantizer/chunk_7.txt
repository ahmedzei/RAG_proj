is serializable or not.

is_trainable:  A property method to determine whether you can fine-tune models on top of the quantization method (with or without PEFT approaches).

Write the validate_environment and update_torch_dtype methods. These methods are called before creating the quantized model to ensure users use the right configuration. You can have a look at how this is done on other quantizers.

Write the _process_model_before_weight_loading method. In Transformers, the quantized models are initialize
