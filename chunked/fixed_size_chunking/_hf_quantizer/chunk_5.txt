/transformers/quantizers/auto.py.

Define the following class attributes/property methods for your quantization method:

requires_calibration: Whether the quantization method requires a data calibration process. If set to True, you can only support inference (with quantized weights) and not inference and quantization.

required_packages: A list of strings of the required packages to use the quantized weights. You might need to define some new utility methods such as is_auto_awq_available in transformers/src
