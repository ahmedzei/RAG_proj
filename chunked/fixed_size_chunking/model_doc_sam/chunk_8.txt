SlimSAM
SlimSAM, a pruned version of SAM, was proposed in 0.1% Data Makes Segment Anything Slim by Zigeng Chen et al. SlimSAM reduces the size of the SAM models considerably while maintaining the same performance.
Checkpoints can be found on the hub, and they can be used as a drop-in replacement of SAM.
