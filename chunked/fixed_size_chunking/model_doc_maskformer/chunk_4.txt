s. If you set the parameter use_auxiliary_loss of [MaskFormerConfig] to True, then prediction feedforward neural networks and Hungarian losses are added after each decoder layer (with the FFNs sharing parameters).
If you want to train the model in a distributed environment across multiple nodes, then one should update the
  get_num_masks function inside in the MaskFormerLoss class of modeling_maskformer.py. When training on multiple nodes, this should be
  set to the average number of target masks across al
