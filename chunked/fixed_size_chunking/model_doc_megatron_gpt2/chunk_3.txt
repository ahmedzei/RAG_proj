ention to the placement of layer normalization in
BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we
achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA
accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy
of 89.4%).
