RWKV
Overview
The RWKV model was proposed in this repo
It suggests a tweak in the traditional Transformer attention to make it linear. This way, the model can be used as recurrent network: passing inputs for timestamp 0 and timestamp 1 together is the same as passing inputs at timestamp 0, then inputs at timestamp 1 along with the state of timestamp 0 (see example below).
This can be more efficient than a regular Transformer and can deal with sentence of any length (even if the model uses a fixed context l
