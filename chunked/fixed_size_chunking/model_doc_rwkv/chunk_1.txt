Usage example

import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, RwkvConfig, RwkvModel
model = RwkvModel.from_pretrained("sgugger/rwkv-430M-pile")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sgugger/rwkv-430M-pile")
inputs = tokenizer("This is an example.", return_tensors="pt")
Feed everything to the model
outputs = model(inputs["input_ids"])
output_whole = outputs.last_hidden_state
outputs = model(inputs["inp
