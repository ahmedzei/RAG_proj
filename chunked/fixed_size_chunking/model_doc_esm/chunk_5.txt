d from sequence data alone. The learned representation
space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to
remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and
can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of
applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure
