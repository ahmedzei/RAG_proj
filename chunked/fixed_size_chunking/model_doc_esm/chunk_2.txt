Also introduced in this paper was ESMFold. It uses an ESM-2 stem with a head that can predict folded protein
structures with state-of-the-art accuracy. Unlike AlphaFold2,
it relies on the token embeddings from the large pre-trained protein language model stem and does not perform a multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) step at inference time, which means that ESMFold checkpoints are fully "standalone" -
they do not require a database of known
