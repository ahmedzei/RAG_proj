"Language models of protein sequences at the scale of evolution enable accurate structure prediction" is
Large language models have recently been shown to develop emergent capabilities with scale, going beyond
simple pattern matching to perform higher level reasoning and generate lifelike images and text. While
language models trained on protein sequences have been studied at a smaller scale, little is known about
