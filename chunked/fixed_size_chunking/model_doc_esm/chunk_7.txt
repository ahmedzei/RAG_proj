what they learn about biology as they are scaled up. In this work we train models up to 15 billion parameters,
the largest language models of proteins to be evaluated to date. We find that as models are scaled they learn
information enabling the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of
individual atoms. We present ESMFold for high accuracy end-to-end atomic level structure prediction directly
from the individual sequence of a protein. ESMFold has similar accuracy to Al
