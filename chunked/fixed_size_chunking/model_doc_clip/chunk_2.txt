ource of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes
with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400
million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference
learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study
the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over
