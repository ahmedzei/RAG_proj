The abstract from the paper is the following:
State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This
restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify
any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a
