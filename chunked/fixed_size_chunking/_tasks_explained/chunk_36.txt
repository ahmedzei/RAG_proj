tence or not, is passed to a feedforward network with a softmax over the two classes (IsNext and NotNext).

The input embeddings are passed through multiple encoder layers to output some final hidden states.

To use the pretrained model for text classification, add a sequence classification head on top of the base BERT model. The sequence classification head is a linear layer that accepts the final hidden states and performs a linear transformation to convert them into logits. The cross-entropy loss is calc
