into logits over the class labels. The cross-entropy loss is calculated between the logits and class label to find the most likely one.
The mask predictions are generated by combining the pixel-embeddings with the final decoder hidden states. The sigmoid cross-entropy and dice loss is calculated between the logits and the ground truth mask to find the most likely mask.
