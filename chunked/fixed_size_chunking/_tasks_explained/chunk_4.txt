o a sequence of feature vectors that are each 20ms long.

Waveforms are continuous by nature, so they can't be divided into separate units like a sequence of text can be split into words. That's why the feature vectors are passed to a quantization module, which aims to learn discrete speech units. The speech unit is chosen from a collection of codewords, known as a codebook (you can think of this as the vocabulary). From the codebook, the vector or speech unit, that best represents the continuous audio inpu
