ngs are passed through multiple decoder blocks to output some final hidden state. Within each decoder block, GPT-2 uses a masked self-attention layer which means GPT-2 can't attend to future tokens. It is only allowed to attend to tokens on the left. This is different from BERT's [mask] token because, in masked self-attention, an attention mask is used to set the score to 0 for future tokens.

The output from the decoder is passed to a language modeling head, which performs a linear transformation to conver
