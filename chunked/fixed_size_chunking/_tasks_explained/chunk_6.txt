nit (the target label).

Now that wav2vec2 is pretrained, you can finetune it on your data for audio classification or automatic speech recognition!
Audio classification
To use the pretrained model for audio classification, add a sequence classification head on top of the base Wav2Vec2 model. The classification head is a linear layer that accepts the encoder's hidden states. The hidden states represent the learned features from each audio frame which can have varying lengths. To create one vector of fixed-l
