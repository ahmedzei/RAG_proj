ntly proposed Vision 
Transformer (ViT) that was designed for image classification specifically, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer 
(PVT), which overcomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction tasks. PVT has several 
merits compared to current state of the arts. Different from ViT that typically yields low resolution outputs and 
incurs high computational and memory costs, PVT not only can be trained on dense partitions of an image to achieve high 
output resolution,
