which is important for dense prediction, but also uses a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the 
computations of large feature maps. PVT inherits the advantages of both CNN and Transformer, making it a unified 
backbone for various vision tasks without convolutions, where it can be used as a direct replacement for CNN backbones. 
We validate PVT through extensive experiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks, including
object detection, instance and semantic segmentation.
