 For example, with a comparable number of parameters, PVT+RetinaNet 
achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO dataset, surpassing ResNet50+RetinNet (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP (see Figure 2). We hope 
that PVT could serve as an alternative and useful backbone for pixel-level predictions and facilitate future research.
