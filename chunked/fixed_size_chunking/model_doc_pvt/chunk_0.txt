Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT)
Overview
The PVT model was proposed in
Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Versatile Backbone for Dense Prediction without Convolutions
by Wenhai Wang, Enze Xie, Xiang Li, Deng-Ping Fan, Kaitao Song, Ding Liang, Tong Lu, Ping Luo, Ling Shao. The PVT is a type of
vision transformer that utilizes a pyramid structure to make it an effective backbone for dense prediction tasks. Specifically
it allows for more fine-grained inputs (4 x 4 pixels per patch) to be used, while simultaneous
