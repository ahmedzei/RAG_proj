iner], set the neftune_noise_alpha parameter in [TrainingArguments] to control how much noise is added.

from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

NEFTune is disabled after training to restore the original embedding layer to avoid any unexpected behavior.

The [Trainer] class is powered by Accelerate, a library for easily training PyTorch models in distributed environments wi
