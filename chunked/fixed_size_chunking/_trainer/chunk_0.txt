Trainer
The [Trainer] is a complete training and evaluation loop for PyTorch models implemented in the Transformers library. You only need to pass it the necessary pieces for training (model, tokenizer, dataset, evaluation function, training hyperparameters, etc.), and the [Trainer] class takes care of the rest. This makes it easier to start training faster without manually writing your own training loop. But at the same time, [Trainer] is very customizable and offers a ton of training options so you can t
