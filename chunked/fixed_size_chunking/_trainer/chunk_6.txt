ta type it could be a tokenizer, feature extractor or image processor), a data collator, and a function to compute the metrics you want to track during training.
Finally, call [~Trainer.train] to start training!

from transformers import Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=dataset["test"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
)
trainer.train()
