DeBERTa-v2
Overview
The DeBERTa model was proposed in DeBERTa: Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention by Pengcheng He, Xiaodong Liu, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen It is based on Google's
BERT model released in 2018 and Facebook's RoBERTa model released in 2019.
It builds on RoBERTa with disentangled attention and enhanced mask decoder training with half of the data used in
RoBERTa.
