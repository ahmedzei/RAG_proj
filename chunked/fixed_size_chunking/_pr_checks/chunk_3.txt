 syntax: Copied from xxx with foo->bar. This means the code is copied with all instances of foo being replaced by bar. You can see how it used here in RobertaAttention with the comment:

Copied from transformers.models.bert.modeling_bert.BertAttention with Bert->Roberta

Note that there shouldn't be any spaces around the arrow (unless that space is part of the pattern to replace of course).
You can add several patterns separated by a comma. For instance here CamemberForMaskedLM is a direct copy of RobertaFo
