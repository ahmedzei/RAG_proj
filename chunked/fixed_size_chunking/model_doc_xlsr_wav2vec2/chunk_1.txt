d latent speech representations and jointly learns a quantization of the latents shared across languages. The
resulting model is fine-tuned on labeled data and experiments show that cross-lingual pretraining significantly
outperforms monolingual pretraining. On the CommonVoice benchmark, XLSR shows a relative phoneme error rate reduction
of 72% compared to the best known results. On BABEL, our approach improves word error rate by 16% relative compared to
a comparable system. Our approach enables a single mu
