XLSR-Wav2Vec2
Overview
The XLSR-Wav2Vec2 model was proposed in Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Representation Learning For Speech Recognition by Alexis Conneau, Alexei Baevski, Ronan Collobert, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Michael
Auli.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
This paper presents XLSR which learns cross-lingual speech representations by pretraining a single model from the raw
waveform of speech in multiple languages. We build on wav2vec 2.0 which is trained by solving a contrastive task over
