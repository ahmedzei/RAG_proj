pre-training
phase, and (3) sound units have variable lengths with no explicit segmentation. To deal with these three problems, we
propose the Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT) approach for self-supervised speech representation learning, which utilizes an
offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like prediction loss. A key ingredient of our
approach is applying the prediction loss over the masked regions only, which forces the model to learn a combined
acoustic and language model over the
