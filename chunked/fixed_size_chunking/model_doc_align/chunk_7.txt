inputs = processor(text=candidate_labels, images=image, return_tensors="pt")
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
this is the image-text similarity score
logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image
we can take the softmax to get the label probabilities
probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)
print(probs)
