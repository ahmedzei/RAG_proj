ALIGN
Overview
The ALIGN model was proposed in Scaling Up Visual and Vision-Language Representation Learning With Noisy Text Supervision by Chao Jia, Yinfei Yang, Ye Xia, Yi-Ting Chen, Zarana Parekh, Hieu Pham, Quoc V. Le, Yunhsuan Sung, Zhen Li, Tom Duerig. ALIGN is a multi-modal vision and language model. It can be used for image-text similarity and for zero-shot image classification. ALIGN features a dual-encoder architecture with EfficientNet as its vision encoder and BERT as its text encoder, and lear
