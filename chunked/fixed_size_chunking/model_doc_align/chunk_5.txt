Usage example
ALIGN uses EfficientNet to get visual features and BERT to get the text features. Both the text and visual features are then projected to a latent space with identical dimension. The dot product between the projected image and text features is then used as a similarity score.
[AlignProcessor] wraps [EfficientNetImageProcessor] and [BertTokenizer] into a single instance to both encode the text and preprocess the images. The foll
