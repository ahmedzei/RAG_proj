ucial platforms for deploying NLP models at scale. However, today's
highly-accurate NLP neural network models such as BERT and RoBERTa are extremely computationally expensive, with
BERT-base taking 1.7 seconds to classify a text snippet on a Pixel 3 smartphone. In this work, we observe that methods
such as grouped convolutions have yielded significant speedups for computer vision networks, but many of these
techniques have not been adopted by NLP neural network designers. We demonstrate how to replace sever
