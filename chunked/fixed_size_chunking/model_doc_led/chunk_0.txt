Overview
The LED model was proposed in Longformer: The Long-Document Transformer by Iz
Beltagy, Matthew E. Peters, Arman Cohan.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales
quadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention
mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of
