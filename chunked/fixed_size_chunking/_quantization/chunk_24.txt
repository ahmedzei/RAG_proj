Only 4-bit models are supported, and we recommend deactivating the ExLlama kernels if you're finetuning a quantized model with PEFT.

The ExLlama kernels are only supported when the entire model is on the GPU. If you're doing inference on a CPU with AutoGPTQ (version > 0.4.2), then you'll need to disable the ExLlama kernel. This overwrites the attributes related to the ExLlama kernels in the quantization config of the config
