well for values ~5, but beyond that, there is a significant performance penalty. A good default threshold value is 6, but a lower threshold may be needed for more unstable models (small models or finetuning).
To find the best threshold for your model, we recommend experimenting with the llm_int8_threshold parameter in [BitsAndBytesConfig]:

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig
model_id = "bigscience/bloom-1b7"
quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    llm_int8_threshold=10,
