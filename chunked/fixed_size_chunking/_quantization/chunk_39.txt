customize the device map with the device_map parameter if you want to (device_map="auto" should only be used for inference).
4-bit

Try 4-bit quantization in this notebook and learn more about it's details in this blog post.

This section explores some of the specific features of 4-bit models, such as changing the compute data type, using the Normal Float 4 (NF4) data type, and using nested quantization.
Compute data type
To speedup computation, you can change the data type from float32 (the default value)
