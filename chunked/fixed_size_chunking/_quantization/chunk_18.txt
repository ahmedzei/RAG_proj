ame dataset from the GPTQ paper.

dataset = ["auto-gptq is an easy-to-use model quantization library with user-friendly apis, based on GPTQ algorithm."]
gptq_config = GPTQConfig(bits=4, dataset=dataset, tokenizer=tokenizer)
Load a model to quantize and pass the gptq_config to the [~AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained] method. Set device_map="auto" to automatically offload the model to a CPU to help fit the model in memory, and allow the model modules to be moved between the CPU and GPU for quantization.
