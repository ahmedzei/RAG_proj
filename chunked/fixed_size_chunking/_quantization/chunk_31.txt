u want:

import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model_4bit = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-350m", load_in_4bit=True, torch_dtype=torch.float32)
model_4bit.model.decoder.layers[-1].final_layer_norm.weight.dtype

If you have bitsandbytes>=0.41.3, you can serialize 4-bit models and push them on Hugging Face Hub. Simply call model.push_to_hub() after loading it in 4-bit precision. You can also save the serialized 4-bit models locally with model.save_pretrained() command.
