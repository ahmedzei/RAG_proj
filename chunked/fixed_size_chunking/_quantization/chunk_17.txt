 models), you need to create a [GPTQConfig] class and set the number of bits to quantize to, a dataset to calibrate the weights for quantization, and a tokenizer to prepare the dataset.

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, GPTQConfig
model_id = "facebook/opt-125m"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
gptq_config = GPTQConfig(bits=4, dataset="c4", tokenizer=tokenizer)

You could also pass your own dataset as a list of strings, but it is highly recommended to use the s
