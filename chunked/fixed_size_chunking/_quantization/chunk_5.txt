AWQ

Try AWQ quantization with this notebook!

Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) doesn't quantize all the weights in a model, and instead, it preserves a small percentage of weights that are important for LLM performance. This significantly reduces quantization loss such that you can run models in 4-bit precision without experiencing any performance degradation.
There are several libraries for quantizing models with the AWQ algorithm, such as llm-awq, autoawq or optimum-intel. T
