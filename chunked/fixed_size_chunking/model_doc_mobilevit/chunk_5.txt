e suggests MobileViT was designed to be performant and efficient on mobile phones. The TensorFlow versions of the MobileViT models are fully compatible with TensorFlow Lite.

You can use the following code to convert a MobileViT checkpoint (be it image classification or semantic segmentation) to generate a
  TensorFlow Lite model:

from transformers import TFMobileViTForImageClassification
import tensorflow as tf
model_ckpt = "apple/mobilevit-xx-small"
model = TFMobileViTForImageClassification.from_pretrain
