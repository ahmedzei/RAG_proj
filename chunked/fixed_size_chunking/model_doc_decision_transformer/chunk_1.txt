 in language modeling such as GPT-x and BERT. In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that 
 casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or 
 compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked 
 Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our
