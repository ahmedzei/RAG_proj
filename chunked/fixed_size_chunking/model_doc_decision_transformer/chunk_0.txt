Decision Transformer
Overview
The Decision Transformer model was proposed in Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling
by Lili Chen, Kevin Lu, Aravind Rajeswaran, Kimin Lee, Aditya Grover, Michael Laskin, Pieter Abbeel, Aravind Srinivas, Igor Mordatch.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We introduce a framework that abstracts Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. 
This allows us to draw upon the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architec
