h_size, num_latents,
d_latents). One must provide inputs (which could be text, images, audio, you name it!) to the model, which it will
use to perform cross-attention with the latents. The output of the Perceiver encoder is a tensor of the same shape. One
can then, similar to BERT, convert the last hidden states of the latents to classification logits by averaging along
the sequence dimension, and placing a linear layer on top of that to project the d_latents to num_labels.
This was the idea of the original
