 Perceiver paper. However, it could only output classification logits. In a follow-up
work, PerceiverIO, they generalized it to let the model also produce outputs of arbitrary size. How, you might ask? The
idea is actually relatively simple: one defines outputs of an arbitrary size, and then applies cross-attention with the
last hidden states of the latents, using the outputs as queries, and the latents as keys and values.
So let's say one wants to perform masked language modeling (BERT-style) with the Perc
