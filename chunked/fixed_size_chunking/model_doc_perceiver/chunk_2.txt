or example,
Perceiver IO can do BERT-style masked language modeling directly using bytes instead of tokenized inputs.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
The recently-proposed Perceiver model obtains good results on several domains (images, audio, multimodal, point
clouds) while scaling linearly in compute and memory with the input size. While the Perceiver supports many kinds of
inputs, it can only produce very simple outputs such as class scores. Perceiver IO overcomes this limitation without
