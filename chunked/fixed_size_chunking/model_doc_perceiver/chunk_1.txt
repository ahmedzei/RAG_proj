 produced a single classification label. In addition to
classification labels, Perceiver IO can produce (for example) language, optical flow, and multimodal videos with audio.
This is done using the same building blocks as the original Perceiver. The computational complexity of Perceiver IO is
linear in the input and output size and the bulk of the processing occurs in the latent space, allowing us to process
inputs and outputs that are much larger than can be handled by standard Transformers. This means, f
