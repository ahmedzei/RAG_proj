crificing the original's appealing properties by learning to flexibly query the model's latent space to produce
outputs of arbitrary size and semantics. Perceiver IO still decouples model depth from data size and still scales
linearly with data size, but now with respect to both input and output sizes. The full Perceiver IO model achieves
strong results on tasks with highly structured output spaces, such as natural language and visual understanding,
StarCraft II, and multi-task and multi-modal domains. As h
