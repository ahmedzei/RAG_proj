Incorrect output when padding tokens aren't masked
In some cases, the output hidden_state may be incorrect if the input_ids include padding tokens. To demonstrate, load a model and tokenizer. You can access a model's pad_token_id to see its value. The pad_token_id may be None for some models, but you can always manually set it.
