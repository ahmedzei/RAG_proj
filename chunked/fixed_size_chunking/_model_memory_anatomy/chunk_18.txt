ecific memory
Then, your software could have special memory needs. For example, when generating text using beam search, the software 
needs to maintain multiple copies of inputs and outputs.
forward vs backward Execution Speed
For convolutions and linear layers there are 2x flops in the backward compared to the forward, which generally translates 
into ~2x slower (sometimes more, because sizes in the backward tend to be more awkward). Activations are usually 
bandwidth-limited, and itâ€™s typical for an activ
