e nvidia-ml-py3
The nvidia-ml-py3 library allows us to monitor the memory usage of the models from within Python. You might be familiar 
with the nvidia-smi command in the terminal - this library allows to access the same information in Python directly.
Then, we create some dummy data: random token IDs between 100 and 30000 and binary labels for a classifier. 
In total, we get 512 sequences each with length 512 and store them in a [~datasets.Dataset] with PyTorch format.
