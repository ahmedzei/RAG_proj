g passed and returned by the forward and the backward functions and the 
forward activations saved for gradient computation.
Temporary Memory
Additionally, there are all kinds of temporary variables which get released once the calculation is done, but in the 
moment these could require additional memory and could push to OOM. Therefore, when coding it's crucial to think 
strategically about such temporary variables and sometimes to explicitly free those as soon as they are no longer needed.
