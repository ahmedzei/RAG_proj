If you plan to run multiple experiments, in order to properly clear the memory between experiments, restart the Python 
 kernel between experiments.

Memory utilization at vanilla training
Let's use the [Trainer] and train the model without using any GPU performance optimization techniques and a batch size of 4:

from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer, logging
logging.set_verbosity_error()
