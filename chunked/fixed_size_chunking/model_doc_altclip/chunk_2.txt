rning and contrastive learning. We validate our method through evaluations of a wide range of tasks. We set new state-of-the-art 
performances on a bunch of tasks including ImageNet-CN, Flicker30k- CN, and COCO-CN. Further, we obtain very close performances with 
CLIP on almost all tasks, suggesting that one can simply alter the text encoder in CLIP for extended capabilities such as multilingual understanding.
