e used to resize (or rescale) and normalize images for the model.
The [AltCLIPProcessor] wraps a [CLIPImageProcessor] and a [XLMRobertaTokenizer] into a single instance to both
encode the text and prepare the images. The following example shows how to get the image-text similarity scores using
[AltCLIPProcessor] and [AltCLIPModel].
