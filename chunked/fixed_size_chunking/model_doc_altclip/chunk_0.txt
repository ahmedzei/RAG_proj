AltCLIP
Overview
The AltCLIP model was proposed in AltCLIP: Altering the Language Encoder in CLIP for Extended Language Capabilities by Zhongzhi Chen, Guang Liu, Bo-Wen Zhang, Fulong Ye, Qinghong Yang, Ledell Wu. AltCLIP
(Altering the Language Encoder in CLIP) is a neural network trained on a variety of image-text and text-text pairs. By switching CLIP's
text encoder with a pretrained multilingual text encoder XLM-R, we could obtain very close performances with CLIP on almost all tasks, and extended origin
