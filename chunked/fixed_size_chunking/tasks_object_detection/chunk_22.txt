vy lifting in the previous sections, so now you are ready to train your model!
The images in this dataset are still quite large, even after resizing. This means that finetuning this model will
require at least one GPU.
Training involves the following steps:
1. Load the model with [AutoModelForObjectDetection] using the same checkpoint as in the preprocessing.
2. Define your training hyperparameters in [TrainingArguments].
3. Pass the training arguments to [Trainer] along with the model, dataset, image proce
