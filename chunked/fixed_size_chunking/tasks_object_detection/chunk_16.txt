Apply this preprocessing function to the entire dataset using ðŸ¤— Datasets [~datasets.Dataset.with_transform] method. This method applies
transformations on the fly when you load an element of the dataset.
At this point, you can check what an example from the dataset looks like after the transformations. You should see a tensor
with pixel_values, a tensor with pixel_mask, and labels.
