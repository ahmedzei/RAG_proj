image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

Before passing the images to the image_processor, apply two preprocessing transformations to the dataset:
- Augmenting images
- Reformatting annotations to meet DETR expectations
First, to make sure the model does not overfit on the training data, you can apply image augmentation with any data augmentation library. Here we use Albumentations 
This library ensures that transformations affect the image and upda
