nding boxes assume that it is in XYWH (x,y co-ordinates and width and height of the box) format. It might not work for other formats like (x1, y1, x2, y2).  
As a final step of getting familiar with the data, explore it for potential issues. One common problem with datasets for
object detection is bounding boxes that "stretch" beyond the edge of the image. Such "runaway" bounding boxes can raise
errors during training and should be addressed at this stage. There are a few examples with this issue in this da
