Inference
Now that you have finetuned a DETR model, evaluated it, and uploaded it to the Hugging Face Hub, you can use it for inference.
The simplest way to try out your finetuned model for inference is to use it in a [Pipeline]. Instantiate a pipeline
for object detection with your model, and pass an image to it:

from transformers import pipeline
import requests
url = "https://i.imgur.com/2lnWoly.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw
