tel CPU, you can also use graph optimizations from Intel Extension for PyTorch to boost inference speed even more. Finally, learn how to use ðŸ¤— Optimum to accelerate inference with ONNX Runtime or OpenVINO (if you're using an Intel CPU).
BetterTransformer
BetterTransformer accelerates inference with its fastpath (native PyTorch specialized implementation of Transformer functions) execution. The two optimizations in the fastpath execution are:

fusion, which combines multiple sequential operations into a sing
