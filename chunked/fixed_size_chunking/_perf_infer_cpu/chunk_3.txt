TorchScript
TorchScript is an intermediate PyTorch model representation that can be run in production environments where performance is important. You can train a model in PyTorch and then export it to TorchScript to free the model from Python performance constraints. PyTorch traces a model to return a [ScriptFunction] that is optimized with just-i
