ixture of Expert (MOE) model with 8 experts per MLP, with a total of 45B paramateres but the compute required is the same as a 14B model. This is because even though each experts have to be loaded in RAM (70B like ram requirement) each token from the hidden states are dispatched twice (top 2 routing) and thus the compute (the operation required at each forward computation) is just 2 X sequence_length. 

The following implementation details are shared with Mistral AI's first model mistral:
