on.GenerationMixin.generate] to translate the input speech
autoregressively to the target language.
The [Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor] class is responsible for preprocessing the input speech and
[Speech2Text2Tokenizer] decodes the generated target tokens to the target string. The
[Speech2Text2Processor] wraps [Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor] and
[Speech2Text2Tokenizer] into a single instance to both extract the input features and decode the
predicted token ids.
