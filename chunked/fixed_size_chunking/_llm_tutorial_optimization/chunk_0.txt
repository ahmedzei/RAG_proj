Optimizing LLMs for Speed and Memory
[[open-in-colab]]
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3/4, Falcon, and Llama are rapidly advancing in their ability to tackle human-centric tasks, establishing themselves as essential tools in modern knowledge-based industries.
Deploying these models in real-world tasks remains challenging, however:

To exhibit near-human text understanding and generation capabilities, LLMs currently require to be composed of billions of parameters (see Kaplan et al, Wei et. al). Th
