that operating at reduced numerical precision, namely 8-bit and 4-bit can achieve computational advantages without a considerable decline in model performance.

Flash Attention: Flash Attention is a variation of the attention algorithm that not only provides a more memory-efficient approach but also realizes increased efficiency due to optimized GPU memory utilization.

Architectural Innovations: Considering that LLMs are always deployed in the same way during inference, namely autoregressive text generatio
