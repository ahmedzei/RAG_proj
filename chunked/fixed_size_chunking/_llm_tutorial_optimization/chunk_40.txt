Question: Can you write some test cases for this function?
Answer: Sure, here are some tests.
assert alternating([10, 20, 30], [1, 2, 3]) == [10, 1, 20, 2, 30, 3]
assert alternating([True, False], [4, 5]) == [True, 4, False, 5]
assert alternating([], []) == []
Question: Modify the function so that it returns all input elements when the lists have uneven length. The elements from the longer list should be at the end.
Answer: Here is the modified function.
def alternating(list1, list2):
   results = []
