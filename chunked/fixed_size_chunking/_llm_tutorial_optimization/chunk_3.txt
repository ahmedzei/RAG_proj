n with a long input context, specialized model architectures have been proposed that allow for more efficient inference. The most important advancement in model architectures hereby are Alibi, Rotary embeddings, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query-Attention (GQA).

Throughout this guide, we will offer an analysis of auto-regressive generation from a tensor's perspective. We delve into the pros and cons of adopting lower precision, provide a comprehensive exploration of the latest attention algorit
