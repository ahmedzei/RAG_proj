ncreased by one at every decoding step.

Making use of the key-value cache means that the \( \mathbf{QK}^T \) is essentially reduced to \( \mathbf{q}_c\mathbf{K}^T \) with \( \mathbf{q}_c \) being the query projection of the currently passed input token which is always just a single vector.

Using the key-value cache has two advantages:
-   Significant increase in computational efficiency as less computations are performed compared to computing the full \( \mathbf{QK}^T \) matrix. This leads to an increase
