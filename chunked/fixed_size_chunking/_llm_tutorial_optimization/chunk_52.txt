token in \( O(1) \) computations regardless of their relative positional distance to each other.
Therefore, for the LLM without position embeddings each token appears to have the same distance to all other tokens, e.g. differentiating between "Hello I love you" and "You love I hello" would be very challenging.
For the LLM to understand sentence order, an additional cue is needed and is usually applied in the form of positional encodings (or also called positional embeddings).
Positional encodings, encode th
