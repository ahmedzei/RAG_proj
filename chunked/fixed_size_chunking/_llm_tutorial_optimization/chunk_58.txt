j} \) thereby represents a rotational matrix. \( \theta \) is not learned during training, but instead set to a pre-defined value that depends on the maximum input sequence length during training.

By doing so, the propability score between \( \mathbf{q}_i \) and \( \mathbf{q}_j \) is only affected if \( i \ne j \) and solely depends on the relative distance \( i - j \) regardless of each vector's specific positions \( i \) and \( j \) .

RoPE is used in multiple of today's most important LLMs, such as:
