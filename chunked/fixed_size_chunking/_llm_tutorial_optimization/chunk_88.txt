l capacity and thus arguably less performance.
Moreover, the authors of GQA found out that existing model checkpoints can be uptrained to have a GQA architecture with as little as 5% of the original pre-training compute. While 5% of the original pre-training compute can still be a massive amount, GQA uptraining allows existing checkpoints to be useful for longer input sequences.
GQA was only recently proposed which is why there is less adoption at the time of writing this notebook.
