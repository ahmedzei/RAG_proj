Nice, we're getting the same result as before, so no loss in accuracy! Let's look at how much memory was used this time.
python
bytes_to_giga_bytes(torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated())
Output:
15.219234466552734
Significantly less! We're down to just a bit over 15 GBs and could therefore run this model on consumer GPUs like the 4090.
We're seeing a very nice gain in memory eff
