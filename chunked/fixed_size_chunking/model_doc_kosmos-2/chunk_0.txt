KOSMOS-2
Overview
The KOSMOS-2 model was proposed in Kosmos-2: Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models to the World by Zhiliang Peng, Wenhui Wang, Li Dong, Yaru Hao, Shaohan Huang, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei.
KOSMOS-2 is a Transformer-based causal language model and is trained using the next-word prediction task on a web-scale
dataset of grounded image-text pairs GRIT. The spatial coordinates of
the bounding boxes in the dataset are converted to a sequence of location tokens, which are appended to their respe
