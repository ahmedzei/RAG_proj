 are
  the bounding boxes (i.e. 2D-positions) of the input tokens. These can be obtained using an external OCR engine such
  as Google's Tesseract (there's a Python wrapper available). Each bounding box should be in (x0, y0, x1, y1) format, where
  (x0, y0) corresponds to the position of the upper left corner in the bounding box, and (x1, y1) represents the
  position of the lower right corner. Note that one first needs to normalize the bounding boxes to be on a 0-1000
  scale. To normalize, you can use the
