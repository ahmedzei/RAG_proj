NLP tasks
such as question answering. However, this knowledge is stored implicitly in the parameters of a neural network,
requiring ever-larger networks to cover more facts. To capture knowledge in a more modular and interpretable way, we
augment language model pre-training with a latent knowledge retriever, which allows the model to retrieve and attend
over documents from a large corpus such as Wikipedia, used during pre-training, fine-tuning and inference. For the
first time, we show how to pre-train such
