ns adam:

pytest -k "not adam" tests/test_optimization.py
And you can combine the two patterns in one:

pytest -k "ada and not adam" tests/test_optimization.py
For example to run both test_adafactor and test_adam_w you can use:

pytest -k "test_adam_w or test_adam_w" tests/test_optimization.py
Note that we use or here, since we want either of the keywords to match to include both.
If you want to include only tests that include both patterns, and is to be used:

pytest -k "test and ada" tests/test_optimizati
