 most of the tests, to run specific subtests you need to know the name of the unittest
class containing those tests. For example, it could be:

pytest tests/test_optimization.py::OptimizationTest::test_adam_w
Here:

tests/test_optimization.py - the file with tests
OptimizationTest - the name of the class
test_adam_w - the name of the specific test function

If the file contains multiple classes, you can choose to run only tests of a given class. For example:

pytest tests/test_optimization.py::OptimizationT
