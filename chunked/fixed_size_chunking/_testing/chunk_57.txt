eed to cover entirely the different internals, while remaining fast. For example,
a significant coverage can be achieved by testing with specially created tiny models with random weights. Such models
have the very minimal number of layers (e.g., 2), vocab size (e.g., 1000), etc. Then the @slow tests can use large
slow models to do qualitative testing. To see the use of these simply look for tiny models with:

Here is a an example of a script that created the tiny model
