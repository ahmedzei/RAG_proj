at least one GPU under pytorch, here is
how to set it up:
python no-style
@require_torch_gpu
@slow
def test_example_slow_on_gpu():
Some decorators like @parametrized rewrite test names, therefore @require_* skip decorators have to be listed
last for them to work correctly. Here is an example of the correct usage:
python no-style
@parameterized.expand()
@require_torch_multi_gpu
def test_integration_foo():
This order problem doesn't exist with @pytest.mark.parametrize, you can put it first or last and it will
