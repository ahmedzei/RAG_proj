 as the documentation or the examples, then we should run these tests in the slow test suite. And then, to refine
this approach we should have exceptions:

All tests that need to download a heavy set of weights or a dataset that is larger than ~50MB (e.g., model or
  tokenizer integration tests, pipeline integration tests) should be set to slow. If you're adding a new model, you
  should create and upload to the hub a tiny version of it (with random weights) for integration tests. This is
