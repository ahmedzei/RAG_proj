e essential for parallel test running, so that the tests won't overwrite
each other's data. Also we want to get the temporary files and directories removed at the end of each test that created
them. Therefore, using packages like tempfile, which address these needs is essential.
However, when debugging tests, you need to be able to see what goes into the temporary file or directory and you want
to know it's exact path and not having it randomized on every test re-run.
