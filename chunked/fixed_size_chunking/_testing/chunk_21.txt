second gpu if you have gpus 0 and 1, you can run:

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1" pytest tests/utils/test_logging.py
This is handy when you want to run different tasks on different GPUs.
Some tests must be run on CPU-only, others on either CPU or GPU or TPU, yet others on multiple-GPUs. The following skip
decorators are used to set the requirements of tests CPU/GPU/TPU-wise:

require_torch - this test will run only under torch
require_torch_gpu - as require_torch plus requires at least 1 GPU
require_torch_multi
