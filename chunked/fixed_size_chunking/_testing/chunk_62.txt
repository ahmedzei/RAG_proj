 if you want to replay the consumed streams:
    sys.stdout.write(out)
    # test:
    assert msg in out

An important potential issue with capturing stdout is that it may contain \r characters that in normal print
reset everything that has been printed so far. There is no problem with pytest, but with pytest -s these
characters get included in the buffer, so to be able to have the test run with and without -s, you have to make an
extra cleanup to the captured output, using re.sub(r'~.*\r', '', buf, 0, re.M
