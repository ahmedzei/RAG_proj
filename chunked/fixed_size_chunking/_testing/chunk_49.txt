 the test summary.

One of the important differences between the two is that skip doesn't run the test, and xfail does. So if the
code that's buggy causes some bad state that will affect other tests, do not use xfail.
Implementation

Here is how to skip whole test unconditionally:

python no-style

def test_feature_x():
or via pytest:
python no-style
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="this bug needs to be fixed")
or the xfail way:
python no-style
@pytest.mark.xfail
