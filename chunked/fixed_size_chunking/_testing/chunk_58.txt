19-en-de. You can easily adjust it to your specific
model's architecture.
It's easy to measure the run-time incorrectly if for example there is an overheard of downloading a huge model, but if
you test it locally the downloaded files would be cached and thus the download time not measured. Hence check the
execution speed report in CI logs instead (the output of pytest --durations=0 tests).
That report is also useful to find slow outliers that aren't marked as such, or which need to be re-written to be fast.
