ssues, by default these context managers automatically replay the captured streams on exit

Capturing logger stream
If you need to validate the output of a logger, you can use CaptureLogger:
thon
from transformers import logging
from transformers.testing_utils import CaptureLogger
msg = "Testing 1, 2, 3"
logging.set_verbosity_info()
logger = logging.get_logger("transformers.models.bart.tokenization_bart")
with CaptureLogger(logger) as cl:
    logger.info(msg)
assert cl.out, msg + "\n"
