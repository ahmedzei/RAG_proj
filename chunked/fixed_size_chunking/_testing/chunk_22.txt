_gpu - as require_torch plus requires at least 2 GPUs
require_torch_non_multi_gpu - as require_torch plus requires 0 or 1 GPUs
require_torch_up_to_2_gpus - as require_torch plus requires 0 or 1 or 2 GPUs
require_torch_tpu - as require_torch plus requires at least 1 TPU

Let's depict the GPU requirements in the following table:
| n gpus | decorator                      |
|--------+--------------------------------|
| >= 0 | @require_torch               |
| >= 1 | @require_torch_gpu           |
