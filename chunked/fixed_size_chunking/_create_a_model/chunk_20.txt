Image processor
An image processor processes vision inputs. It inherits from the base [~image_processing_utils.ImageProcessingMixin] class.
To use, create an image processor associated with the model you're using. For example, create a default [ViTImageProcessor] if you are using ViT for image classification:

from transformers import ViTImageProcessor
vit_extractor = ViTImageProcessor()
print(vit_extractor)
ViTImageProcessor {
  "do_normalize": true,
  "do_resize": true,
  "image_processor_type": "Vi
