ask (e.g., object detection). Start by initializing a backbone in the model config and specify whether you want to load pretrained weights or load randomly initialized weights. Then you can pass the model config to the model head.
For example, to load a ResNet backbone into a MaskFormer model with an instance segmentation head:

Set use_pretrained_backbone=True to load pretrained ResNet weights for the backbone.

from transformers import MaskFormerConfig, MaskFormerForInstanceSegmentation, ResNetConfig
conf
