generally better to use a pretrained model to obtain better results faster, while using only a fraction of the resources required for training.
Create a pretrained model with [~TFPreTrainedModel.from_pretrained]:

tf_model = TFDistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")

When you load pretrained weights, the default model configuration is automatically loaded if the model is provided by ðŸ¤— Transformers. However, you can still replace - some or all of - the default model configuratio
