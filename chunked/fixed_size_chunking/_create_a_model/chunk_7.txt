l - also loosely referred to as the architecture - defines what each layer is doing and what operations are happening. Attributes like num_hidden_layers from the configuration are used to define the architecture. Every model shares the base class [PreTrainedModel] and a few common methods like resizing input embeddings and pruning self-attention heads. In addition, all models are also either a torch.nn.Module, tf.keras.Model or flax.linen.Module subclass. This means models are compatible with each of their
