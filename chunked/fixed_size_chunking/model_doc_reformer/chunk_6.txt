X^{1}{i, k}, & \text{if }\ i < d^1 \text{ with } k = j \mod n_s^1 \

Intuitively, this means that a position embedding vector \(x_j \in \mathbb{R}^{d}\) is now the composition of two
factorized embedding vectors: \(x^1_{k, l} + x^2_{l, k}\), where as the config.max_embedding_size dimension
\(j\) is factorized into \(k \text{ and } l\). This design ensures that each position embedding vect
