or
\(x_j\) is unique.
Using the above example again, axial position encoding with \(d^1 = 2^9, d^2 = 2^9, n_s^1 = 2^9, n_s^2 = 2^{10}\)
can drastically reduced the number of parameters from 500 000 000 to \(2^{18} + 2^{19} \approx 780 000\) parameters, this means 85% less memory usage.
In practice, the parameter config.axial_pos_embds_dim is set to a tuple \((d^1, d^2)\) which sum has to be
equal to config.hidden_size and config.axial_pos_shape is set to a tuple \((n_s^1, n_s^2)\) which
product has to be eq
