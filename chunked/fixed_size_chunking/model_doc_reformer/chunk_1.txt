nsitive hashing, changing its
complexity from O(L^2) to O(Llog(L)), where L is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual
layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of
N times, where N is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models
while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.
