 of length config.lsh_chunk_length. For each chunk, the query embedding vectors attend to its key vectors
(which are tied to themselves) and to the key embedding vectors of config.lsh_num_chunks_before previous
neighboring chunks and config.lsh_num_chunks_after following neighboring chunks.
For more information, see the original Paper or this great blog post.
Note that config.num_buckets can also be factorized into a list \((n_{\text{buckets}}^1,
n_{\text{buckets}}^2)\). This way instead of assigning the qu
