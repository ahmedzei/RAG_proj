unk of length config.local_chunk_length the query embedding vectors only attends to
the key embedding vectors in its chunk and to the key embedding vectors of config.local_num_chunks_before
previous neighboring chunks and config.local_num_chunks_after following neighboring chunks.
Using Local self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation can be reduced from
\(\mathcal{O}(n_s \times n_s)\) to \(\mathcal{O}(n_s \times \log(n_s))\), which usually represents the memory
and tim
