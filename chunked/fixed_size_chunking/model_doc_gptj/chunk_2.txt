would take much more GPU RAM. Adam
  optimizer for example makes four copies of the model: model, gradients, average and squared average of the gradients.
  So it would need at least 4x model size GPU memory, even with mixed precision as gradient updates are in fp32. This
  is not including the activations and data batches, which would again require some more GPU RAM. So one should explore
  solutions such as DeepSpeed, to train/fine-tune the model. Another option is to use the original codebase to
  train/
