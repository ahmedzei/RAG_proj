subclass [Trainer] and override the methods you need (see trainer for examples).
By default, TrainingArguments.report_to is set to "all", so a [Trainer] will use the following callbacks.

[DefaultFlowCallback] which handles the default behavior for logging, saving and evaluation.
[PrinterCallback] or [ProgressCallback] to display progress and print the
  logs (the first one is used if you deactivate tqdm through the [TrainingArguments], otherwise
  it's the second one).
