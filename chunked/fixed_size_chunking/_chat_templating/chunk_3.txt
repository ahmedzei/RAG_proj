that string will also be tokenized for us. To see a more complex template in action, though, let's use the

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1")
chat = [
   {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
   {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm doing great. How can I help you today?"},
   {"role": "user", "content": "I'd like to show off how chat templating works!"},
