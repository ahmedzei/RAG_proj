Notes on whitespace
As much as possible, we've tried to get Jinja to ignore whitespace outside of {{ expressions }}. However, be aware
that Jinja is a general-purpose templating engine, and it may treat whitespace between blocks on the same line
as significant and print it to the output. We strongly recommend checking that your template isn't printing extra
spaces where it shouldn't be before you upload it!
