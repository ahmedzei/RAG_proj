ng layer separated, which means that they should not be trained down the line.
Training would desynchronize the two layers, leading to unexpected results.
This is not the case for models that do not have a language model head, as those do not
have tied weights. These models can be safely exported without the torchscript flag.
Dummy inputs and standard lengths
The dummy inputs are used for a models forward pass. While the inputs' values are
propagated through the layers, PyTorch keeps track of the different
