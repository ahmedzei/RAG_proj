here are two PyTorch modules, JIT and
TRACE, that allow developers to export their
models to be reused in other programs like efficiency-oriented C++ programs.
We provide an interface that allows you to export ðŸ¤— Transformers models to TorchScript
so they can be reused in a different environment than PyTorch-based Python programs.
Here, we explain how to export and use our models using TorchScript.
Exporting a model requires two things:

model instantiation with the torchscript flag
a forward pass with dummy
