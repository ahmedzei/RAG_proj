operations executed
on each tensor. These recorded operations are then used to create the trace of the
model.
The trace is created relative to the inputs' dimensions. It is therefore constrained by
the dimensions of the dummy input, and will not work for any other sequence length or
batch size. When trying with a different size, the following error is raised:
`The expanded size of the tensor (3) must match the existing size (7) at non-singleton dimension 2`
We recommended you trace the model with a dummy in
