Export to TorchScript

This is the very beginning of our experiments with TorchScript and we are still
exploring its capabilities with variable-input-size models. It is a focus of interest to
us and we will deepen our analysis in upcoming releases, with more code examples, a more
flexible implementation, and benchmarks comparing Python-based codes with compiled
TorchScript.

According to the TorchScript documentation:

TorchScript is a way to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code.
