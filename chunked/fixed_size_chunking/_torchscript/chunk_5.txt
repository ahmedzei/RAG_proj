put size at least as large as the
largest input that will be fed to the model during inference. Padding can help fill the
missing values. However, since the model is traced with a larger input size, the
dimensions of the matrix will also be large, resulting in more calculations.
Be careful of the total number of operations done on each input and follow the
performance closely when exporting varying sequence-length models.
