t need to specify one unless you want to:

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)  # No loss argument!

The last two things to setup before you start training is to compute the accuracy from the predictions, and provide a way to push your model to the Hub. Both are done by using Keras callbacks.
Pass your compute_metrics function to [~transformers.KerasMetricCallback]:

from transformers.keras_callbacks import KerasMetricCallback
metric_callback = KerasMetricCallback(metric_fn=compute_metrics, eval_dataset=tf_v
