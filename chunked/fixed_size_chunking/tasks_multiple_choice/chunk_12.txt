Evaluate
Including a metric during training is often helpful for evaluating your model's performance. You can quickly load a evaluation method with the ðŸ¤— Evaluate library. For this task, load the accuracy metric (see the ðŸ¤— Evaluate quick tour to learn more about how to load and compute a metric):

import evaluate
accuracy = evaluate.load
