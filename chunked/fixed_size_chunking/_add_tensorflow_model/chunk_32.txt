Debugging mismatches across ML frameworks 🐛
At some point, when adding a new architecture or when creating TensorFlow weights for an existing architecture, you
might come across errors complaining about mismatches between PyTorch and TensorFlow. You might even decide to open the
model architecture code for the two frameworks, and find that they look identical. What's going on? 🤔
First of all, let's talk about why understanding these mismatches matters. Many c
