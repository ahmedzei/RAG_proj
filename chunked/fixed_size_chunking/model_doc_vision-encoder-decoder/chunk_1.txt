After such a [VisionEncoderDecoderModel] has been trained/fine-tuned, it can be saved/loaded just like any other models (see the examples below
for more information).
An example application is image captioning, in which the encoder is used to encode the image, after which an autoregressive language model generates
the caption. Another example is optical character recognition. Refer to TrOCR, which is an instance of
