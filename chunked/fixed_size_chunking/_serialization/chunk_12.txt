Use transformers.onnx package as a Python module to export a checkpoint using a ready-made configuration:

python -m transformers.onnx --model=distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased onnx/
This exports an ONNX graph of the checkpoint defined by the --model argument. Pass any checkpoint on the ðŸ¤— Hub or one that's stored locally.
The resulting model.onnx file can then be run on one of the many accelerators that support the ONNX standard. For example, 
load and run the model with ONNX Runtime as follows:
