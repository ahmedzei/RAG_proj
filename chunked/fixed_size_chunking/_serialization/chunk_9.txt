outputs = model(**inputs)

The process is identical for TensorFlow checkpoints on the Hub. For instance, here's how you would
export a pure TensorFlow checkpoint from the Keras organization:

optimum-cli export onnx --model keras-io/transformers-qa distilbert_base_cased_squad_onnx/
Exporting a ðŸ¤— Transformers model to ONNX with optimum.onnxruntime
Alternative to CLI, you can export a ðŸ¤— Transformers model to ONNX programmatically like so: 
thon

from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForSequenceClassi
