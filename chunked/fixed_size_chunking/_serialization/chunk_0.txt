Export to ONNX
Deploying ðŸ¤— Transformers models in production environments often requires, or can benefit from exporting the models into 
a serialized format that can be loaded and executed on specialized runtimes and hardware.
ðŸ¤— Optimum is an extension of Transformers that enables exporting models from PyTorch or TensorFlow to serialized formats 
such as ONNX and TFLite through its exporters module. ðŸ¤— Optimum also provides a set of performance optimization tools to train 
and run models on targeted hardwar
