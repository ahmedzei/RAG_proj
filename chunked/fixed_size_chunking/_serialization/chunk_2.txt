to
construct a computational graph (often called an intermediate representation) which
represents the flow of data through the neural network.
By exposing a graph with standardized operators and data types, ONNX makes it easy to
switch between frameworks. For example, a model trained in PyTorch can be exported to
ONNX format and then imported in TensorFlow (and vice versa).
Once exported to ONNX format, a model can be:
- optimized for inference via techniques such as graph optimization and quantization. 
-
