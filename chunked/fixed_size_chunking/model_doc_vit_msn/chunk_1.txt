We propose Masked Siamese Networks (MSN), a self-supervised learning framework for learning image representations. Our
approach matches the representation of an image view containing randomly masked patches to the representation of the original
unmasked image. This self-supervised pre-training strategy is particularly scalable when applied to Vision Transformers since only the
unmasked patches are processed by the network. As a result, MSNs improve the scalability of joint-embedding architectu
