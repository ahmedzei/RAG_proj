MSN (masked siamese networks) is a method for self-supervised pre-training of Vision Transformers (ViTs). The pre-training
objective is to match the prototypes assigned to the unmasked views of the images to that of the masked views of the same images.
The authors have only released pre-trained weights of the backbone (ImageNet-1k pre-training). So, to use that on your own image classification dataset,
use the [ViTMSNForImageClassification] class which is initialized from [ViTMSNModel]. Foll
