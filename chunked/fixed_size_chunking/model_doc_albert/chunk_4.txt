n), whereas hidden states are context dependent (one hidden state represents a sequence of tokens) so it's more logical to have H >> E. Also, the embedding matrix is large since it's V x E (V being the vocab size). If E < H, it has less parameters.
Layers are split in groups that share parameters (to save memory).
Next sentence prediction is replaced by a sentence ordering prediction: in the inputs, we have two sentences A and B (that are consecutive) and we either feed A followed by B or B followed by A. T
