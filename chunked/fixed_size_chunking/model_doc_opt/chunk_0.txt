OPT
Overview
The OPT model was proposed in Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models by Meta AI.
OPT is a series of open-sourced large causal language models which perform similar in performance to GPT3.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Large language models, which are often trained for hundreds of thousands of compute days, have shown remarkable capabilities for zero- and few-shot learning. Given their computational cost, these models are difficult to replicate without significant capital.
