CLIPSeg
Overview
The CLIPSeg model was proposed in Image Segmentation Using Text and Image Prompts by Timo LÃ¼ddecke
and Alexander Ecker. CLIPSeg adds a minimal decoder on top of a frozen CLIP model for zero- and one-shot image segmentation.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Image segmentation is usually addressed by training a
model for a fixed set of object classes. Incorporating additional classes or more complex queries later is expensive
as it requires re-training the model on a dataset tha
