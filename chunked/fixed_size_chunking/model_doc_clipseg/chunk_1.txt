t encompasses these expressions. Here we propose a system
that can generate image segmentations based on arbitrary
prompts at test time. A prompt can be either a text or an
image. This approach enables us to create a unified model
(trained once) for three common segmentation tasks, which
come with distinct challenges: referring expression segmentation, zero-shot segmentation and one-shot segmentation.
We build upon the CLIP model as a backbone which we extend with a transformer-based decoder that enables de
