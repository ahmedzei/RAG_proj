 position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right 
rather than the left.
An example:
thon

from transformers import BlenderbotTokenizer, BlenderbotForConditionalGeneration
mname = "facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill"
model = BlenderbotForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(mname)
tokenizer = BlenderbotTokenizer.from_pretrained(mname)
UTTERANCE = "My friends are cool but they eat too many carbs."
inputs = tokenizer([UTTERANCE], return_tensors="pt")
reply_ids = model.generate(**input
