Implementation Notes

Blenderbot uses a standard seq2seq model transformer based architecture.
Available checkpoints can be found in the model hub.
This is the default Blenderbot model class. However, some smaller checkpoints, such as
  facebook/blenderbot_small_90M, have a different architecture and consequently should be used with
  BlenderbotSmall.
