MegatronBERT
Overview
The MegatronBERT model was proposed in Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model
Parallelism by Mohammad Shoeybi, Mostofa Patwary, Raul Puri, Patrick LeGresley,
Jared Casper and Bryan Catanzaro.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in
Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to tra
