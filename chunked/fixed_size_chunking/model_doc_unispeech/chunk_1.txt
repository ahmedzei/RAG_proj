lf-supervised learning are conducted in a multi-task learning manner. The resultant representations can capture
information more correlated with phonetic structures and improve the generalization across languages and domains. We
evaluate the effectiveness of UniSpeech for cross-lingual representation learning on public CommonVoice corpus. The
results show that UniSpeech outperforms self-supervised pretraining and supervised transfer learning for speech
recognition by a maximum of 13.4% and 17.8% relative ph
