Spout Vector
A Spout Vector is a special vector for controlling text generation.
This vector is treated as the first embedding in self-attention to bring extraneous attention to the generated tokens.
In the pre-trained model published from Tanrei/GPTSAN-japanese, the Spout Vector is a 128-dimensional vector that passes through 8 fully connected layers in the model and is projected into the space
