Prefix-LM as token_type_ids.
The model treats the part where token_type_ids is 1 as a Prefix part, that is, the input can refer to both tokens before and after.
Usage tips
Specifying the Prefix part is done with a mask passed to self-attention.
When token_type_ids=None or all zero, it is equivalent to regular causal mask
for example:

x_token = tokenizer("ｱｲｳｴ")
input_ids:      | SOT | SEG | ｱ | ｲ | ｳ | ｴ |
token_type_ids: | 1   | 0   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
prefix_lm_mask:
SOT | 1 0 0 0 0 0 |
SEG | 1 1 0 0 0 0 |
