LLaVa
Overview
LLaVa is an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LlamA/Vicuna on GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data. It is an auto-regressive language model, based on the transformer architecture. In other words, it is an multi-modal version of LLMs fine-tuned for chat / instructions.
The LLaVa model was proposed in Visual Instruction Tuning and improved in Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning by Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li and Yong Jae Lee.
