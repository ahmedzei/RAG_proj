e knowledge-enhanced token representations: LUKE learns rich information
    (or knowledge) about Wikipedia entities during pretraining and stores the information in its entity embedding. By
    using Wikipedia entities as input tokens, LUKE outputs token representations enriched by the information stored in
    the embeddings of these entities. This is particularly effective for tasks requiring real-world knowledge, such as
    question answering.

There are three head models for the former use case:
