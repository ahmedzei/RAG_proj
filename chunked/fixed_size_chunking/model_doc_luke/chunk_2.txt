e task involves
predicting randomly masked words and entities in a large entity-annotated corpus retrieved from Wikipedia. We also
propose an entity-aware self-attention mechanism that is an extension of the self-attention mechanism of the
transformer, and considers the types of tokens (words or entities) when computing attention scores. The proposed model
achieves impressive empirical performance on a wide range of entity-related tasks. In particular, it obtains
state-of-the-art results on five well-known
