Overview
The LUKE model was proposed in LUKE: Deep Contextualized Entity Representations with Entity-aware Self-attention by Ikuya Yamada, Akari Asai, Hiroyuki Shindo, Hideaki Takeda and Yuji Matsumoto.
It is based on RoBERTa and adds entity embeddings as well as an entity-aware self-attention mechanism, which helps

extractive and cloze-style question answering, entity typing, and relat
