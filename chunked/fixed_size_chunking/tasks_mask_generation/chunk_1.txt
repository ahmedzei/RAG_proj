n image and a prompt, where a prompt can be a 2D point location (XY coordinates) in the image within an object or a bounding box surrounding an object. In prompting mode, the model only returns the mask over the object 
that the prompt is pointing out. 
- Segment Everything mode: In segment everything, given an image, the model generates every mask in the image. To do so, a grid of points is generated and overlaid on the image for inference. 
Mask generation task is supported by Segment Anything Model (SAM)
