ine. To do so, initialize the model and
the processor.

from transformers import SamModel, SamProcessor
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = SamModel.from_pretrained("facebook/sam-vit-base").to(device)
processor = SamProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/sam-vit-base")

To do point prompting, pass the input point to the processor, then take the processor output
and pass it to the model for inference. To post-process the model output, pass the outputs and
