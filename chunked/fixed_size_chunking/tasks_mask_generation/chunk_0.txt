Mask generation is the task of generating semantically meaningful masks for an image. 
This task is very similar to image segmentation, but many differences exist. Image segmentation models are trained on labeled datasets and are limited to the classes they have seen during training; they return a set of masks and corresponding classes, given an image. 
Mask generation models are trained on large amounts of data and operate in two modes. 
- Prompting mode: In this mode, the model takes in a
