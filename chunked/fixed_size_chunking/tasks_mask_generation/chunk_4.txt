Let's segment everything. points-per-batch enables parallel inference of points in segment everything mode. This enables faster inference, but consumes more memory. Moreover, SAM only enables batching over points and not the images. pred_iou_thresh is the IoU confidence threshold where only the masks above that certain threshold are returned.
python
masks = mask_generator(image, points_per_batch=128, pred_iou
