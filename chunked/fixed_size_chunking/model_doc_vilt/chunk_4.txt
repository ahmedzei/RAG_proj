  under 640 while preserving the aspect ratio. To make batching of images possible, the authors use a pixel_mask that indicates
  which pixel values are real and which are padding. [ViltProcessor] automatically creates this for you.
The design of ViLT is very similar to that of a standard Vision Transformer (ViT). The only difference is that the model includes
  additional embedding layers for the language modality.
The PyTorch version of this model is only available in torch 1.10 and highe
