rely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region supervision
(e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g., ResNet). Although disregarded in the literature, we
find it problematic in terms of both (1) efficiency/speed, that simply extracting input features requires much more
computation than the multimodal interaction steps; and (2) expressive power, as it is upper bounded to the expressive
power of the visual embedder and its predefined visual vocabulary. In this
