cessing step, create a batch of examples using DefaultDataCollator. Unlike other data collators in ðŸ¤— Transformers, the
DefaultDataCollator does not apply additional preprocessing, such as padding.

from transformers import DefaultDataCollator
data_collator = DefaultDataCollator(return_tensors="tf")

Including a metric during training is often helpful for evaluating your model's performance. You can quickly load an
evaluation method with the ðŸ¤— Evaluate library. For this task, load
