Congratulations! You have fine-tuned your model and shared it on the ðŸ¤— Hub. You can now use it for inference!

For a more in-depth example of how to finetune a model for image classification, take a look at the corresponding PyTorch notebook.

Inference
Great, now that you've fine-tuned a model, you can use it for inference!
Load an image you'd like to run inference on:

ds = load_dataset("food101", split="validation[:10]")
image = ds["i
