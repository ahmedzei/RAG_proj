At this point, only three steps remain:

Define your training hyperparameters in [TrainingArguments]. It is important you don't remove unused columns because that'll drop the image column. Without the image column, you can't create pixel_values. Set remove_unused_columns=False to prevent this behavior! The only other required parameter is output_dir which specifies where to save your model. You'
