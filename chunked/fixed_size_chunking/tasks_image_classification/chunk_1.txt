rks before spending more time training on the full dataset.

from datasets import load_dataset
food = load_dataset("food101", split="train[:5000]")

Split the dataset's train split into a train and test set with the [~datasets.Dataset.train_test_split] method:

Each example in the dataset has two fields:

image: a PIL image of the food item
label: the label class of the food item
