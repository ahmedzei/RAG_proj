2. Instantiate a pre-trained model.
3. Convert a ðŸ¤— Dataset to a tf.data.Dataset.
4. Compile your model.
5. Add callbacks and use the fit() method to run the training.
6. Upload your model to ðŸ¤— Hub to share with the community.
Start by defining the hyperparameters, optimizer and learning rate schedule:

from transformers import create_optimizer
batch_size = 16
num_epochs = 5
num_train_steps = len(food["train"]) * num_epochs
learning_rate = 3e-5
weight_decay_rate = 0.01
optimizer, lr_schedule = create_optimi
