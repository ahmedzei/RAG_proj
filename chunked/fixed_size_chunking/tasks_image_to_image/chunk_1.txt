peline only supports super resolution task.
Let's begin by installing the necessary libraries.

pip install transformers
We can now initialize the pipeline with a Swin2SR model. We can then infer with the pipeline by calling it with an image. As of now, only Swin2SR models are supported in this pipeline. 
thon
from transformers import pipeline
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
pipe = pipeline(task="image-to-image", model="caidas/swin2SR-lightweight-x2-64", device=device)
