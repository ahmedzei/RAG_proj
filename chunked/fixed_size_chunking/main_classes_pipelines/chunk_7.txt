for out in pipe(KeyDataset(dataset, "text"), batch_size=8, truncation="only_first"):
    print(out)

    # Exactly the same output as before, but the content are passed
    # as batches to the model

However, this is not automatically a win for performance. It can be either a 10x speedup or 5x slowdown depending
on hardware, data and the actual model being used.
Example where it's mostly a speedup:

thon
from transformers import pipeline
from torch
