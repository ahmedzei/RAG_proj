python
all_model_outputs = []
for preprocessed in pipe.preprocess(inputs):
    model_outputs = pipe.forward(preprocessed)
    all_model_outputs.append(model_outputs)
outputs = pipe.postprocess(all_model_outputs)
This should be very transparent to your code because the pipelines are used in
the same way.
This is a simplified view, since the pipeline can handle automatically the batch to ! Meaning you don't have to care
about how many forward passes you inputs are actually going to trigger, you can optim
