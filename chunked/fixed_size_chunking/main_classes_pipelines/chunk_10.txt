saturated the GPU)

Example where it's most a slowdown:
thon
class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def len(self):
        return 5000
def __getitem__(self, i):
    if i % 64 == 0:
        n = 100
    else:
        n = 1
    return "This is a test" * n

This is a occasional very long sentence compared to the other. In that case, the whole batch will need to be 400
tokens long, so the whole batch will be [64, 400] instead of [64, 4], leading to the high slowdown. Even worse, on
bigger batches, the program simply cras
