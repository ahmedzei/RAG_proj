h ("natural" data), by default don't batch, measure and
    try tentatively to add it, add OOM checks to recover when it will fail (and it will at some point if you don't
    control the sequence_length.)

If your sequence_length is super regular, then batching is more likely to be VERY interesting, measure and push
    it until you get OOMs.
The larger the GPU the more likely batching is going to be more interesting
As soon as you enable batching, make sure you can handle OOMs nicely.
