Preprocess

The next step is to load a T5 tokenizer to process the English-French language pairs:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
checkpoint = "google-t5/t5-small"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

Prefix the input with a prompt so T5 knows this is a translation task. Some models capable of multiple NLP tasks require prompting for specific tasks.
Tokenize the input (English) and tar
