b with the [~transformers.Trainer.push_to_hub] method so everyone can use your model:

trainer.push_to_hub()

If you aren't familiar with finetuning a model with Keras, take a look at the basic tutorial here!

To finetune a model in TensorFlow, start by setting up an optimizer function, learning rate schedule, and some training hyperparameters:

from transformers import AdamWeightDecay
optimizer = AdamWeightDecay(learning_rate=2e-5, weight_decay_rate=0.01)

Then you can load T5 with [TFAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
