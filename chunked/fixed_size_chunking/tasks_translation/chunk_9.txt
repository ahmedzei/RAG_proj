eady to start training your model now! Load T5 with [AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM]:

from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, Seq2SeqTrainingArguments, Seq2SeqTrainer
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

At this point, only three steps remain:

Define your training hyperparameters in [Seq2SeqTrainingArguments]. The only required parameter is output_dir which specifies where to save your model. You'll push this model to the Hub by setting push_to_hub=True (you need to be signed in to Hu
