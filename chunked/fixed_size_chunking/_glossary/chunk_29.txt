PipelineParallel (PP)
Parallelism technique in which the model is split up vertically (layer-level) across multiple GPUs, so that only one or 
several layers of the model are placed on a single GPU. Each GPU processes in parallel different stages of the pipeline 
and working on a small chunk of the batch. Learn more about how PipelineParallel works here.
pixel values
A tensor of the numerical representations of an image that is passed to a model. The pixel values have a shape of [batch_size, num_channels,
