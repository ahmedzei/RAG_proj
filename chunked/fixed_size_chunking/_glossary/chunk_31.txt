identify each token's position in the
list of tokens.
They are an optional parameter. If no position_ids are passed to the model, the IDs are automatically created as
absolute positional embeddings.
Absolute positional embeddings are selected in the range [0, config.max_position_embeddings - 1]. Some models use
other types of positional embeddings, such as sinusoidal position embeddings or relative position embeddings.
