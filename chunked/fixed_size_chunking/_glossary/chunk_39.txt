allelism technique for training on multiple GPUs in which each tensor is split up into multiple chunks, so instead of 
having the whole tensor reside on a single GPU, each shard of the tensor resides on its designated GPU. Shards gets 
processed separately and in parallel on different GPUs and the results are synced at the end of the processing step. 
This is what is sometimes called horizontal parallelism, as the splitting happens on horizontal level.
