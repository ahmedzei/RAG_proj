e
token indices are under the key input_ids:
thon

encoded_sequence = inputs["input_ids"]
print(encoded_sequence)
[101, 138, 18696, 155, 1942, 3190, 1144, 1572, 13745, 1104, 159, 9664, 2107, 102]

Note that the tokenizer automatically adds "special tokens" (if the associated model relies on them) which are special
IDs the model sometimes uses.
If we decode the previous sequence of ids,
thon

decoded_sequence = tokenizer.decode(encoded_sequence)

we will see
thon

print(decoded_sequence)
