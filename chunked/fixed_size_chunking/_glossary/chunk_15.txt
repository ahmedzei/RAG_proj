head
The model head refers to the last layer of a neural network that accepts the raw hidden states and projects them onto a different dimension. There is a different model head for each task. For example:

[GPT2ForSequenceClassification] is a sequence classification head - a linear layer - on top of the base [GPT2Model].
[ViTForImageClassification] is an image classification head - a linear layer on top of the
