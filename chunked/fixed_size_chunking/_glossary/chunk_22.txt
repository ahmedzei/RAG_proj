For token classification models, ([BertForTokenClassification]), the model expects a tensor of dimension
  (batch_size, seq_length) with each value corresponding to the expected label of each individual token.
For masked language modeling, ([BertForMaskedLM]), the model expects a tensor of dimension (batch_size,
