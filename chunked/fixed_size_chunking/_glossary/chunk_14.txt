e function [apply_chunking_to_forward], the chunk_size defines the number of output
embeddings that are computed in parallel and thus defines the trade-off between memory and time complexity. If
chunk_size is set to 0, no feed forward chunking is done.
finetuned models
Finetuning is a form of transfer learning which involves taking a pretrained model, freezing its weights, and replacing the output layer with a newly added model head. The model head is trained on your target dataset.
