labels
The labels are an optional argument which can be passed in order for the model to compute the loss itself. These labels
should be the expected prediction of the model: it will use the standard loss in order to compute the loss between its
predictions and the expected value (the label).
These labels are different according to the model head, for example:

For sequence classification models, ([BertForSequenceCl
