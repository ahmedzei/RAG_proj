This can then be converted into a tensor in PyTorch or TensorFlow. The attention mask is a binary tensor indicating the
position of the padded indices so that the model does not attend to them. For the [BertTokenizer], 1 indicates a
value that should be attended to, while 0 indicates a padded value. This attention mask is in the dictionary returned
by the tokenizer under the key "attention_mask":
