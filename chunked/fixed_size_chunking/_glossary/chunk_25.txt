lue of the batch corresponding to the expected label of each individual pixel.
For object detection models, ([DetrForObjectDetection]), the model expects a list of dictionaries with a
  class_labels and boxes key where each value of the batch corresponds to the expected label and number of bounding boxes of each individual image.
For automatic speech recognition models, ([Wav2Vec2ForCTC]), the model expects a tensor of dimension (batch_size,
  target_length) with each value corresponding to the expected lab
