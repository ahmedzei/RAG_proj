sequence_b = "This is a rather long sequence. It is at least longer than the sequence A."
encoded_sequence_a = tokenizer(sequence_a)["input_ids"]
encoded_sequence_b = tokenizer(sequence_b)["input_ids"]

The encoded versions have different lengths:

len(encoded_sequence_a), len(encoded_sequence_b)
(8, 19)

Therefore, we can't put them together in the same tensor as-is. The first sequence needs to be padded up to the length
of the second one, or the second one needs to be truncated down t
