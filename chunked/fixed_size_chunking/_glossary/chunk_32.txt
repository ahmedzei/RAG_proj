 machine learning models. For example, text is typically preprocessed by tokenization. To gain a better idea of what preprocessing looks like for other input types, check out the Preprocess tutorial.
pretrained model
A model that has been pretrained on some data (for instance all of Wikipedia). Pretraining methods involve a
self-supervised objective, which can be reading the text and trying to predict the next word (see causal language
modeling) or masking some words and trying to predict them (see masked l
