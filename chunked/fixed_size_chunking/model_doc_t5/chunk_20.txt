optimizer. Typically, 1e-4 and 3e-4 work well for most problems (classification, summarization, translation, question
answering, question generation). Note that T5 was pre-trained using the AdaFactor optimizer.

According to this forum post, task prefixes matter when
(1) doing multi-task training (2) your task is similar or related to one of the supervised tasks used in T5's
pre-training mixture (see Appendix D of the paper for the task prefixes
used).
If training on TPU, it is recommended to pad a
