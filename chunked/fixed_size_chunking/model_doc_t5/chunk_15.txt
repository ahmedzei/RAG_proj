during T5's pre-training.
However, the example above only shows a single training example. In practice, one trains deep learning models in
batches. This entails that we must pad/truncate examples to the same length. For encoder-decoder models, one
typically defines a max_source_length and max_target_length, which determine the maximum length of the
input and output sequences respectively (otherwise they are truncated). These should be carefully set depending on
the task.
In addition, we must make sure that
