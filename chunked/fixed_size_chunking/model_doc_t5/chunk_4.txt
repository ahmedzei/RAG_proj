rvised training uses corrupted tokens, by randomly removing 15% of the tokens and replacing them with individual sentinel tokens (if several consecutive tokens are marked for removal, the whole group is replaced with a single sentinel token). The input of the encoder is the corrupted sentence, the input of the decoder is the original sentence and the target is then the dropped out tokens delimited by their sentinel tokens.

T5 uses relative scalar embeddings. Encoder input padding can be done on the left an
