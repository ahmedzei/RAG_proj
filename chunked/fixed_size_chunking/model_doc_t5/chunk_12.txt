s setup, the input sequence and output sequence are a standard sequence-to-sequence input-output mapping.
Suppose that we want to fine-tune the model for translation for example, and we have a training example: the input
sequence "The house is wonderful." and output sequence "Das Haus ist wunderbar.", then they should be prepared for
the model as follows:

from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google-t5/t5-small")
model = T5ForConditio
