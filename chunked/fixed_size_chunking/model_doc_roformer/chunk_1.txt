ion named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE). The
proposed RoPE encodes absolute positional information with rotation matrix and naturally incorporates explicit relative
position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE comes with valuable properties such as flexibility of
being expand to any sequence lengths, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and
capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. As a result, the enhanced
