Audio Spectrogram Transformer
Overview
The Audio Spectrogram Transformer model was proposed in AST: Audio Spectrogram Transformer by Yuan Gong, Yu-An Chung, James Glass.
The Audio Spectrogram Transformer applies a Vision Transformer to audio, by turning audio into an image (spectrogram). The model obtains state-of-the-art results
for audio classification.
