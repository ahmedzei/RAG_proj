MRA
Overview
The MRA model was proposed in Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA) for Approximate Self-Attention by Zhanpeng Zeng, Sourav Pal, Jeffery Kline, Glenn M Fung, and Vikas Singh.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Transformers have emerged as a preferred model for many tasks in natural language processing and vision. Recent efforts on training and deploying Transformers more efficiently have identified many strategies to approximate the self-attention matrix, a key module in a Transformer arc
