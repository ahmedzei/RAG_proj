The abstract from the paper is the following:
While the general idea of self-supervised learning is identical across modalities, the actual algorithms and
objectives differ widely because they were developed with a single modality in mind. To get us closer to general
self-supervised learning, we present data2vec, a framework that uses the same learning method for either speech,
NLP or computer vision. The core idea is to predict latent representations of the full input data based on a
masked view of
