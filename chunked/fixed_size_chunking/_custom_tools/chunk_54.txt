Future compatibility with Langchain
We love Langchain and think it has a very compelling suite of tools. In order to handle these tools,
Langchain requires textual inputs and outputs, even when working with different modalities.
This is often the serialized version (i.e., saved to disk) of the objects.
This difference means that multi-modality isn't handled between transformers-agents and langchain.
We aim for this limitation to be resolved in future versions, and welcome any
