==Explanation from the agent==
I will use the following tool:image_segmenter` to create a segmentation mask for the image.
==Code generated by the agent==
mask = image_segmenter(image, prompt="tree")

which is probably not what we wanted. Instead, it is more likely that we want an image of a tree to be generated.
To steer the agent more towards using a specific tool it can therefore be very helpful to use important keywords that 
are present in the tool's name and description. Let's have a look.
