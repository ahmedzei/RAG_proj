Usage tips

The Persimmon models were trained using bfloat16, but the original inference uses float16 The checkpoints uploaded on the hub use torch_dtype = 'float16' which will be
used by the AutoModel API to cast the checkpoints from torch.float32 to torch.float16. 
The dtype of the online weights is mostly irrelevant, unless you are using torch_dtype="auto" when initializing a model using model = AutoMode
