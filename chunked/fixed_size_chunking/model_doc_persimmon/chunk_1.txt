context size (16K), performance, and capabilities for multimodal extensions.
The authors showcase their approach to model evaluation, focusing on practical text generation, mirroring how users interact with language models. The work also includes a comparative analysis, pitting Persimmon-8B against other prominent models (MPT 7B Instruct and Llama 2 Base 7B 1-Shot), across various evaluation tasks. The results demonstrate Persimmon-8B's competitive performance, even with limited training data.
