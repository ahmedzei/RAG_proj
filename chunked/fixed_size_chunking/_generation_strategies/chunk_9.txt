ecoding strategies that support multiple sequence candidates, e.g. variations of beam search and sampling. Decoding
strategies like greedy search and contrastive search return a single output sequence.

Save a custom decoding strategy with your model
If you would like to share your fine-tuned model with a specific generation configuration, you can:
* Create a [GenerationConfig] class instance
* Specify the decoding strategy parameters
* Save your generation configuration with [GenerationConfig.save_pretrain
