 the output combined with the input prompt to a maximum of 20
tokens to avoid running into resource limitations. The default decoding strategy is greedy search, which is the simplest decoding strategy that picks a token with the highest probability as the next token. For many tasks
and small output sizes this works well. However, when used to generate longer outputs, greedy search can start
producing highly repetitive results.
