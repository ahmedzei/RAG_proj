Streaming
The generate() supports streaming, through its streamer input. The streamer input is compatible with any instance
from a class that has the following methods: put() and end(). Internally, put() is used to push new tokens and
end() is used to flag the end of text generation.

The API for the streamer classes is still under development and may change in the future.

In practice, you can craft your own streaming class for all sorts of purposes! We also have basic streaming classes
