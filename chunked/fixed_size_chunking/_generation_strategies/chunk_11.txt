u can also store several generation configurations in a single directory, making use of the config_file_name
argument in [GenerationConfig.save_pretrained]. You can later instantiate them with [GenerationConfig.from_pretrained]. This is useful if you want to
store several generation configurations for a single model (e.g. one for creative text generation with sampling, and
one for summarization with beam search). You must have the right Hub permissions to add configuration files to a model.
