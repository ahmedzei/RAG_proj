models, we combined novel and modified versions of existing automatic metrics to evaluate prosody, latency, and robustness. For human evaluations, we adapted existing protocols tailored for measuring the most relevant attributes in the preservation of meaning, naturalness, and expressivity. To ensure that our models can be used safely and responsibly, we implemented the first known red-teaming effort for multimodal machine translation, a system for the detection and mitigation of added toxicity, a systemati
