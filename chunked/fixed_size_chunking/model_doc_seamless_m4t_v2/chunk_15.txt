seq2seq) models. The first model translates the input modality into translated text, while the second model generates speech tokens, known as "unit tokens," from the translated text.
Each modality has its own dedicated encoder with a unique architecture. Additionally, for speech output, a vocoder inspired by the HiFi-GAN architecture is placed on top of the second seq2seq model.
Difference with SeamlessM4T-v1
The architecture of this new version differs from the first in a few aspects:
