econd-pass model
The second seq2seq model, named text-to-unit model, is now non-auto regressive, meaning that it computes units in a single forward pass. This achievement is made possible by:
- the use of character-level embeddings, meaning that each character of the predicted translated text has its own embeddings, which are then used to predict the unit tokens.
- the use of an intermediate duration predictor, that predicts speech duration at the character-level on the predicted translated text.
- the use
