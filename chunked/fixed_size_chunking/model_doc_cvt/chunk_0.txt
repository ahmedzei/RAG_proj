Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT)
Overview
The CvT model was proposed in CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers by Haiping Wu, Bin Xiao, Noel Codella, Mengchen Liu, Xiyang Dai, Lu Yuan and Lei Zhang. The Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) improves the Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs.
