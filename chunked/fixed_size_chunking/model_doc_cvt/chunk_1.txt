l vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) 
in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs. This is accomplished through 
two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer 
block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
to the ViT architecture (\ie shift, scale, an
