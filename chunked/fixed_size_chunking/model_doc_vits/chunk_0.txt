VITS
Overview
The VITS model was proposed in Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Adversarial Learning for End-to-End Text-to-Speech by Jaehyeon Kim, Jungil Kong, Juhee Son.
VITS (Variational Inference with adversarial learning for end-to-end Text-to-Speech) is an end-to-end 
speech synthesis model that predicts a speech waveform conditional on an input text sequence. It is a conditional variational 
autoencoder (VAE) comprised of a posterior encoder, decoder, and conditional prior.
