] classes and they're adapted for training models for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as summarization or translation.

The [Trainer] class is optimized for ðŸ¤— Transformers models and can have surprising behaviors
when used with other models. When using it with your own model, make sure:

your model always return tuples or subclasses of [~utils.ModelOutput]
your model can compute the loss if a labels argument is provided and that loss is returned as the first
  element of the tuple (if your model returns tup
