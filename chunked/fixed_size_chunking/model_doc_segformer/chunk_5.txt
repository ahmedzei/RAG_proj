on head, and replace it by the all-MLP decode head. Next, they fine-tune the model altogether on
  ADE20K, Cityscapes and COCO-stuff, which are important benchmarks for semantic segmentation. All checkpoints can be
  found on the hub.
The quickest way to get started with SegFormer is by checking the example notebooks (which showcase both inference and
  fine-tuning on custom data). One can also check out the blog post introducing SegFormer and illustrating how it can be fine-tuned on custom data.
