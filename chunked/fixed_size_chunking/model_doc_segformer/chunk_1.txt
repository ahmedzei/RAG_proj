tic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with
lightweight multilayer perception (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a novel
hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding,
thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution
differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregate
