SegFormer
Overview
The SegFormer model was proposed in SegFormer: Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers by Enze Xie, Wenhai Wang, Zhiding Yu, Anima Anandkumar, Jose M. Alvarez, Ping
Luo. The model consists of a hierarchical Transformer encoder and a lightweight all-MLP decode head to achieve great
results on image segmentation benchmarks such as ADE20K and Cityscapes.
