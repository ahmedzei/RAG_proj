s information from
different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We
show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our
approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance
and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters,
being 5x smaller and 2.2%
