mentation maps for background. However, ADE20k doesn't include the "background" class in its 150 labels.
  Therefore, reduce_labels is used to reduce all labels by 1, and to make sure no loss is computed for the
  background class (i.e. it replaces 0 in the annotated maps by 255, which is the ignore_index of the loss function
  used by [SegformerForSemanticSegmentation]). However, other datasets use the 0 index as
  background class and include this class as part of all labels. In that case, reduce_labels s
