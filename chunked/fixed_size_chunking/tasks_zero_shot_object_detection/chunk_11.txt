Batch processing
You can pass multiple sets of images and text queries to search for different (or same) objects in several images.
Let's use both an astronaut image and the beach image together.
For batch processing, you should pass text queries as a nested list to the processor and images as lists of PIL images,
PyTorch tensors, or NumPy arrays.

images = [image, im]
text_q
