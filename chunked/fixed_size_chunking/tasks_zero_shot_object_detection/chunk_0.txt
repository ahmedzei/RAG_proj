Zero-shot object detection
[[open-in-colab]]
Traditionally, models used for object detection require labeled image datasets for training,
and are limited to detecting the set of classes from the training data.
Zero-shot object detection is supported by the OWL-ViT model which uses a different approach. OWL-ViT
is an open-vocabulary object detector. It means that it can detect objects in images based on free-text queries without
the need to fine-tune the model on labeled datasets.
OWL-ViT leverages multi-mo
