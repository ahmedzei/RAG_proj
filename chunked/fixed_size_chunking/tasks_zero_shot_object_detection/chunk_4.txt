Pass the image and the candidate object labels to look for to the pipeline.
Here we pass the image directly; other suitable options include a local path to an image or an image url. We also pass text descriptions for all items we want to query the image for. 

predictions = detector(
     image,
     candidate_labels=["human face", "rocket", "nasa badge", "star-spangled banner"],
 )
