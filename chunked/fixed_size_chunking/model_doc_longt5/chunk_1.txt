Recent work has shown that either (1) increasing the input length or (2) increasing model size can improve the
performance of Transformer-based neural models. In this paper, we present a new model, called LongT5, with which we
explore the effects of scaling both the input length and model size at the same time. Specifically, we integrated
attention ideas from long-input transformers (ETC), and adopted pre-training strategies from summarization pre-training
(PEGASUS) into the scalable
