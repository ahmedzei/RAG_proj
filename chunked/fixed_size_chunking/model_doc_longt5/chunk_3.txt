 exchanging the traditional
encoder self-attention layer with efficient either local attention or transient-global (tglobal) attention.
Unlike the T5 model, LongT5 does not use a task prefix. Furthermore, it uses a different pre-training objective
inspired by the pre-training of [PegasusForConditionalGeneration].
LongT5 model is designed to work efficiently and very well on long-range sequence-to-sequence tasks where the
input sequence exceeds commonly used 512 tokens. It is capable of handling input sequen
