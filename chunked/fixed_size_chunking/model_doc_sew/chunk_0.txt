SEW
Overview
SEW (Squeezed and Efficient Wav2Vec) was proposed in Performance-Efficiency Trade-offs in Unsupervised Pre-training
for Speech Recognition by Felix Wu, Kwangyoun Kim, Jing Pan, Kyu Han, Kilian Q.
Weinberger, Yoav Artzi.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
This paper is a study of performance-efficiency trade-offs in pre-trained models for automatic speech recognition
(ASR). We focus on wav2vec 2.0, and formalize several architecture designs that influence both the model performance
