nd its efficiency. Putting together all our observations, we introduce SEW (Squeezed and Efficient Wav2vec), a
pre-trained model architecture with significant improvements along both performance and efficiency dimensions across a
variety of training setups. For example, under the 100h-960h semi-supervised setup on LibriSpeech, SEW achieves a 1.9x
inference speedup compared to wav2vec 2.0, with a 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate. With a similar inference
time, SEW reduces word error rate by 25-50%
