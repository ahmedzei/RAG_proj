Quantization" operations to unquantize the weights.

It's common to extract the output from the expansion layers at indices 10 and 13, as well as the output from the final 1x1 convolution layer, for downstream purposes. Using output_hidden_states=True returns the output from all intermediate layers. There is currently no way to limit this to specific layers.

The DeepLabV3+ segmentation head does not use the final convolution layer from the backbone, but this layer gets computed anyway. There is currently n
