ext (e.g., what are the two tokens to the
left and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Also, by stacking attention layers that have a small
window, the last layer will have a receptive field of more than just the tokens in the window, allowing them to build a
representation of the whole sentence.
Some preselected input tokens are also given global attention: for those few tokens, the attention matrix can access
all tokens and this process is symmetric: all other tokens have access to those s
