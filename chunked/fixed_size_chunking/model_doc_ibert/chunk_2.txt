ithmetic. Based on lightweight integer-only approximation methods for
nonlinear operations, e.g., GELU, Softmax, and Layer Normalization, I-BERT performs an end-to-end integer-only BERT
inference without any floating point calculation. We evaluate our approach on GLUE downstream tasks using
RoBERTa-Base/Large. We show that for both cases, I-BERT achieves similar (and slightly higher) accuracy as compared to
the full-precision baseline. Furthermore, our preliminary implementation of I-BERT shows a speedup of
