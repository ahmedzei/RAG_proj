 for
efficient inference at the edge, and even at the data center. While quantization can be a viable solution for this,
previous work on quantizing Transformer based models use floating-point arithmetic during inference, which cannot
efficiently utilize integer-only logical units such as the recent Turing Tensor Cores, or traditional integer-only ARM
processors. In this work, we propose I-BERT, a novel quantization scheme for Transformer based models that quantizes
the entire inference with integer-only ar
