Second, for better speaker discrimination, we propose an utterance mixing strategy for data augmentation, where
additional overlapped utterances are created unsupervisedly and incorporate during training. We integrate the proposed
methods into the HuBERT framework. Experiment results on SUPERB benchmark show that the proposed system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in universal representation learning, especially for speaker identification oriented
tasks. An ablation study is performed verifying the e
