eat successes in applying self-supervised learning in
speech recognition, while limited exploration was attempted in applying SSL for modeling speaker characteristics. In
this paper, we aim to improve the existing SSL framework for speaker representation learning. Two methods are
introduced for enhancing the unsupervised speaker information extraction. First, we apply the multi-task learning to
the current SSL framework, where we integrate the utterance-wise contrastive loss with the SSL objective function.
