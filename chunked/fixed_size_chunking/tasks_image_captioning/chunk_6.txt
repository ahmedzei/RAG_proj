With the dataset ready, you can now set up the model for fine-tuning. 
Load a base model
Load the "microsoft/git-base" into a AutoModelForCausalLM object.

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

Evaluate
Image captioning models are typically evaluated with the Rouge Score or Word Error Rate. For this guide, you will use the Word Error Rat
