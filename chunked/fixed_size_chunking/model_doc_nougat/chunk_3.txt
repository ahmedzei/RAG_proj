fine-tuning on custom data.
Nougat is always used within the VisionEncoderDecoder framework. The model is identical to Donut in terms of architecture.

Inference
Nougat's [VisionEncoderDecoder] model accepts images as input and makes use of
[~generation.GenerationMixin.generate] to autoregressively generate text given the input image.
The [NougatImageProcessor] class is responsible for preprocessing the input image and
[NougatTokenizerFast] decodes the generated target tokens to the target string. The
[Noug
