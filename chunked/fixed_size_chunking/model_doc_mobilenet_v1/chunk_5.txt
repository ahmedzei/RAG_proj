his gives a pooled output that is larger than 1x1 pixel. The HuggingFace implementation does not support this.

It is currently not possible to specify an output_stride. For smaller output strides, the original model invokes dilated convolution to prevent the spatial resolution from being reduced further. The output stride of the HuggingFace model is always 32.

The original TensorFlow checkpoints include quantized models. We do not support these models as they include additional "FakeQuantization" operatio
