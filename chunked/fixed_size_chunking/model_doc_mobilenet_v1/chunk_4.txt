nsorFlow checkpoints use different padding rules than PyTorch, requiring the model to determine the padding amount at inference time, since this depends on the input image size. To use native PyTorch padding behavior, create a [MobileNetV1Config] with tf_padding = False.

Unsupported features:

The [MobileNetV1Model] outputs a globally pooled version of the last hidden state. In the original model it is possible to use a 7x7 average pooling layer with stride 2 instead of global pooling. For larger inputs, t
