checkpoint is trained on images of specific size, the model will work on images of any size. The smallest supported image size is 32x32.

One can use [MobileNetV1ImageProcessor] to prepare images for the model.

The available image classification checkpoints are pre-trained on ImageNet-1k (also referred to as ILSVRC 2012, a collection of 1.3 million images and 1,000 classes). However, the model predicts 1001 classes: the 1000 classes from ImageNet plus an extra “background” class (index 0).
