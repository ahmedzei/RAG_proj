 be fine-tuned on multiple language at once and decode unseen languages in a single forward pass
  to a sequence of phonemes
By default, the model outputs a sequence of phonemes. In order to transform the phonemes to a sequence of words one
  should make use of a dictionary and language model.

Wav2Vec2Phoneme's architecture is based on the Wav2Vec2 model, for API reference, check out Wav2Vec2's documentation page
