se methods. This paper extends previous work on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer
learning by fine-tuning a multilingually pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model to transcribe unseen languages. This is done by
mapping phonemes of the training languages to the target language using articulatory features. Experiments show that
this simple method significantly outperforms prior work which introduced task-specific architectures and used only part
of a monolingually pretrained model.
