r that combines two types of preprocessing tools. For example, the LayoutLMV2 model requires an image processor to handle images and a tokenizer to handle text; a processor combines both of them.
Load a processor with [AutoProcessor.from_pretrained]:

from transformers import AutoProcessor
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("microsoft/layoutlmv2-base-uncased")

AutoModel

The AutoModelFor classes let you load a pretrained model for a given task (see here for a complete list of available tasks). For e
