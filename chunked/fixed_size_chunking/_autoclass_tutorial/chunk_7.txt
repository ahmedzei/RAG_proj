AutoFeatureExtractor
For audio tasks, a feature extractor processes the audio signal the correct input format.
Load a feature extractor with [AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained]:

from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor
feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(
     "ehcalabres/wav2vec2-lg-xlsr-en-speech-emotion-recognition"
 )
