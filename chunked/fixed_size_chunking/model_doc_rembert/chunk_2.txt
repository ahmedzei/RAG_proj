 shows that larger
output embeddings prevent the model's last layers from overspecializing to the pre-training task and encourage
Transformer representations to be more general and more transferable to other tasks and languages. Harnessing these
findings, we are able to train models that achieve strong performance on the XTREME benchmark without increasing the
number of parameters at the fine-tuning stage.
Usage tips
For fine-tuning, RemBERT can be thought of as a bigger version of mBERT with an ALBERT-like
