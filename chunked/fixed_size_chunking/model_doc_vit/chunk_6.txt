onverted the weights from Ross Wightman's timm library, 
who already converted the weights from JAX to PyTorch. Credits go to him!
Usage tips

To feed images to the Transformer encoder, each image is split into a sequence of fixed-size non-overlapping patches,
  which are then linearly embedded. A [CLS] token is added to serve as representation of an entire image, which can be
  used for classification. The authors also add absolute position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of
  vectors to a stan
