e summary (like sequence classification or multiple choice). For other
  tasks, the full model is used; this full model has a decoder that upsamples the final hidden states to the same
  sequence length as the input.
For tasks such as classification, this is not a problem, but for tasks like masked language modeling or token classification, we need a hidden state with the same sequence length as the original input. In those cases, the final hidden states are upsampled to the input sequence length and go thr
