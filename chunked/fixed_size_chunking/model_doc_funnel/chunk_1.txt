tures of good
scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the
much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only
require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which
gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More
importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs
