Big Transfer (BiT)
Overview
The BiT model was proposed in Big Transfer (BiT): General Visual Representation Learning by Alexander Kolesnikov, Lucas Beyer, Xiaohua Zhai, Joan Puigcerver, Jessica Yung, Sylvain Gelly, Neil Houlsby.
BiT is a simple recipe for scaling up pre-training of ResNet-like architectures (specifically, ResNetv2). The method results in significant improvements for transfer learning.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
