d approach, using the [~Agent.chat] method:
py
agent.chat("Generate a picture of rivers and lakes")
 
py
agent.chat("Transform the picture so that there is a rock in there")

This is an interesting approach when you want to keep the state across instructions. It's better for experimentation, 
but will tend to be much better at single instructions rather than complex instructions (which the [~Agent.run]
method is better at handling).
This method can also take arguments if you would like to pass non-text type
