 the agents to perform actions for you. However, the agent is only generating code
that we then execute using a very restricted Python interpreter. In case you would like to use the code generated in

python
agent.run("Draw me a picture of rivers and lakes", return_code=True)
returns the following code

from transformers import load_tool
