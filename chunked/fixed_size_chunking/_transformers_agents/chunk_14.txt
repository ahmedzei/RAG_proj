age model, and we're prompting it so that it has access to a specific set of tools.
LLMs are pretty good at generating small samples of code, so this API takes advantage of that by prompting the 
LLM gives a small sample of code performing a task with a set of tools. This prompt is then completed by the 
task you give your agent and the description of the tools you give it. This way it gets access to the doc of the
