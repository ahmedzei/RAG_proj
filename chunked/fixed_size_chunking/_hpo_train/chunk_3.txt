ive values. The Pareto Front (List[BestRun]) will be returned in hyperparameter_search, you should refer to the test case TrainerHyperParameterMultiObjectOptunaIntegrationTest in test_trainer. It's like following

best_trials = trainer.hyperparameter_search(
     direction=["minimize", "maximize"],
     backend="optuna",
     hp_space=optuna_hp_space,
     n_trials=20,
     compute_objective=compute_objective,
 )

For raytune, see raytune object_parameter, it's like following:
