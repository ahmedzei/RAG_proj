If you aren't familiar with finetuning a model with the [Trainer], take a look at the basic tutorial here!

You're ready to start training your model now! Load DistilBERT with [AutoModelForTokenClassification] along with the number of expected labels, and the label mappings:

from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(
     "distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased", num_labels=13, id2label=id2label, label2id=label
