optimizer function, learning rate schedule, and some training hyperparameters:

from transformers import create_optimizer
batch_size = 16
num_train_epochs = 3
num_train_steps = (len(tokenized_wnut["train"]) // batch_size) * num_train_epochs
optimizer, lr_schedule = create_optimizer(
     init_lr=2e-5,
     num_train_steps=num_train_steps,
     weight_decay_rate=0.01,
     num_warmup_steps=0,
 )

Then you can load DistilBERT with [TFAutoModelForTokenClassification] along with the number of expected labels, a
