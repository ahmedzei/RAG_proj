is task, load the seqeval framework (see the ðŸ¤— Evaluate quick tour to learn more about how to load and compute a metric). Seqeval actually produces several scores: precision, recall, F1, and accuracy.

import evaluate
seqeval = evaluate.load("seqeval")

Get the NER labels first, and then create a function that passes your true predictions and true labels to [~evaluate.EvaluationModule.compute] to calculate the scores:

import numpy as np
labels = [label_list[i] for i in example[f"ner_tags"]]
