For a more in-depth example of how to finetune a model for token classification, take a look at the corresponding

or TensorFlow notebook.

Inference
Great, now that you've finetuned a model, you can use it for inference!
Grab some text you'd like to run inference on:

text = "The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco."

The simplest way to try out your finetuned model for inference is to use it in a [pipeline]. Instantiate
