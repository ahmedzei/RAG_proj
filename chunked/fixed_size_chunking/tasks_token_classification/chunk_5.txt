cial tokens [CLS] and [SEP] and the subword tokenization creates a mismatch between the input and labels. A single word corresponding to a single label may now be split into two subwords. You'll need to realign the tokens and labels by:

Mapping all tokens to their corresponding word with the word_ids method.
Assigning the label -100 to the special tokens [CLS] and [SEP] so they're ignored by the PyTorch loss function (see CrossEntropyLoss).
Only labeling the first token of a given word. Assign -100 to othe
