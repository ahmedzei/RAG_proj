st consists of simple lightweight convolutions to complement the detailed information required by matting. To the best of our knowledge, ViTMatte is the first work to unleash the potential of ViT on image matting with concise adaptation. It inherits many superior properties from ViT to matting, including various pretraining strategies, concise architecture design, and flexible inference strategies. We evaluate ViTMatte on Composition-1k and Distinctions-646, the most commonly used benchmark for image mattin
