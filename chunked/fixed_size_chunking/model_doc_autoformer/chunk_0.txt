Autoformer
Overview
The Autoformer model was proposed in Autoformer: Decomposition Transformers with Auto-Correlation for Long-Term Series Forecasting by Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long.
This model augments the Transformer as a deep decomposition architecture, which can progressively decompose the trend and seasonal components during the forecasting process.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications, such as ext
