The transcription is decent, but it could be better! Try finetuning your model on more examples to get even better results!

You can also manually replicate the results of the pipeline if you'd like:

Load a processor to preprocess the audio file and transcription and return the input as PyTorch tensors:

from transformers import AutoProcessor
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("stevhliu/my_awesome_asr_mind_model")
inputs = processor(dataset[0]["audio"]["array"], sampling_rate=sampling_r
