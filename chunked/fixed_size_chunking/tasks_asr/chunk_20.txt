The simplest way to try out your finetuned model for inference is to use it in a [pipeline]. Instantiate a pipeline for automatic speech recognition with your model, and pass your audio file to it:

from transformers import pipeline
transcriber = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition", model="stevhliu/my_awesome_asr_minds_model")
transcriber(audio_file)
