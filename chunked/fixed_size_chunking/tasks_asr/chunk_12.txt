         # replace padding with -100 to ignore loss correctly
         labels = labels_batch["input_ids"].masked_fill(labels_batch.attention_mask.ne(1), -100)
         batch["labels"] = labels
         return batch

Now instantiate your DataCollatorForCTCWithPadding:

data_collator = DataCollatorCTCWithPadding(processor=processor, padding="longest")
