Encoder Decoder Models
Overview
The [EncoderDecoderModel] can be used to initialize a sequence-to-sequence model with any
pretrained autoencoding model as the encoder and any pretrained autoregressive model as the decoder.
The effectiveness of initializing sequence-to-sequence models with pretrained checkpoints for sequence generation tasks
was shown in Leveraging Pre-trained Checkpoints for Sequence Generation Tasks by
Sascha Rothe, Shashi Narayan, Aliaksei Severyn.
After such an [EncoderDecoderModel] has
