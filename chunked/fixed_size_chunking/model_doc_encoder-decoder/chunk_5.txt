ncoderDecoderModel.from_encoder_decoder_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-uncased", "google-bert/bert-base-uncased")

Loading an existing EncoderDecoderModel checkpoint and perform inference.
To load fine-tuned checkpoints of the EncoderDecoderModel class, [EncoderDecoderModel] provides the from_pretrained() method just like any other model architecture in Transformers.
To perform inference, one uses the [generate] method, which allows to autoregressively generate text. This method supports various forms of
