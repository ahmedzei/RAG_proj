retrained decoder.
[EncoderDecoderModel] can be initialized from a pretrained encoder checkpoint and a pretrained decoder checkpoint. Note that any pretrained auto-encoding model, e.g. BERT, can serve as the encoder and both pretrained auto-encoding models, e.g. BERT, pretrained causal language models, e.g. GPT2, as well as the pretrained decoder part of sequence-to-sequence models, e.g. decoder of BART, can be used as the decoder.
Depending on which architecture you choose as the decoder, the cross-attenti
