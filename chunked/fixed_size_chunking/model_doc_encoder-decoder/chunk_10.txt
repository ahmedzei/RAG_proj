This is only for copying some specific attributes of this particular model.
model.config = _model.config

Training
Once the model is created, it can be fine-tuned similar to BART, T5 or any other encoder-decoder model.
As you can see, only 2 inputs are required for the model in order to compute a loss: input_ids (which are the
input_ids of the encoded input sequence) and labels (which are the input_ids of the encoded
target sequence).
