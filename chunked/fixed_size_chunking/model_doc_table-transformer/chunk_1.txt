The abstract from the paper is the following:
Recently, significant progress has been made applying machine learning to the problem of table structure inference and extraction from unstructured documents.
However, one of the greatest challenges remains the creation of datasets with complete, unambiguous ground truth at scale. To address this, we develop a new, more
comprehensive dataset for table extraction, called PubTables-1M. PubTables-1M contains nearly one million tables from scientific articles, suppo
