rts multiple input
modalities, and contains detailed header and location information for table structures, making it useful for a wide variety of modeling approaches. It also addresses a significant
source of ground truth inconsistency observed in prior datasets called oversegmentation, using a novel canonicalization procedure. We demonstrate that these improvements lead to a
significant increase in training performance and a more reliable estimate of model performance at evaluation for table structure reco
