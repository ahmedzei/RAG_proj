Table Transformer
Overview
The Table Transformer model was proposed in PubTables-1M: Towards comprehensive table extraction from unstructured documents by
Brandon Smock, Rohith Pesala, Robin Abraham. The authors introduce a new dataset, PubTables-1M, to benchmark progress in table extraction from unstructured documents,
as well as table structure recognition and functional analysis. The authors train 2 DETR models, one for table detection and one for table structure recognition, dubbed Table Transformers.
