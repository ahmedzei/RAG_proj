 attention model. Along the way, our
theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having O(1) global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire
sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to
8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context,
BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also
