 as random attention to the input sequence. Theoretically, it
has been shown that applying sparse, global, and random attention approximates full attention, while being
computationally much more efficient for longer sequences. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context,
BigBird has shown improved performance on various long document NLP tasks, such as question answering and
summarization, compared to BERT or RoBERTa.
