Backbone
A backbone is a model used for feature extraction for higher level computer vision tasks such as object detection and image classification. Transformers provides an [AutoBackbone] class for initializing a Transformers backbone from pretrained model weights, and two utility classes:

[~utils.BackboneMixin] enables initializing a backbone from Transformers or timm and includes functions for returning the output features and indices.
[~utils.BackboneConfigMixin] sets the output features and indices o
