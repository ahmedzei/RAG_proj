 allow to flexibly benchmark ðŸ¤— Transformers models. The benchmark classes allow us to measure the peak memory usage and required time for both inference and training.

Hereby, inference is defined by a single forward pass, and training is defined by a single forward pass and
backward pass.

The benchmark classes [PyTorchBenchmark] and [TensorFlowBenchmark] expect an object of type [PyTorchBenchmarkArguments] and
[TensorFlowBenchmarkArguments], respectively, for instantiation. [PyTorchBenchmarkArguments] and
