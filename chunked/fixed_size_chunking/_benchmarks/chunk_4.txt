s on which the model is benchmarked. There are many more parameters that can be configured
via the benchmark argument data classes. For more detail on these one can either directly consult the files
src/transformers/benchmark/benchmark_args_utils.py, src/transformers/benchmark/benchmark_args.py (for PyTorch)
and src/transformers/benchmark/benchmark_args_tf.py (for Tensorflow). Alternatively, running the following shell
commands from root will print out a descriptive list of all configurable parameters for P
