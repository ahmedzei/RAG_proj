Again, inference time and required memory for inference are measured, but this time for customized configurations
of the BertModel class. This feature can especially be helpful when deciding for which configuration the model
should be trained.
Benchmark best practices
This section lists a couple of best practices one should be aware of when benchmarking a model.

Currently, only single device benchmarking is supported. When benchmarking on GPU
