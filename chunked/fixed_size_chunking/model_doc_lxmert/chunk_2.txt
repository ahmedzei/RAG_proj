age connections. In LXMERT, we
build a large-scale Transformer model that consists of three encoders: an object relationship encoder, a language
encoder, and a cross-modality encoder. Next, to endow our model with the capability of connecting vision and language
semantics, we pre-train the model with large amounts of image-and-sentence pairs, via five diverse representative
pretraining tasks: masked language modeling, masked object prediction (feature regression and label classification),
cross-modality mat
