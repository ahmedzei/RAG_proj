th, is a tensor with the values
being the depth expressed in meters for each pixel.
The second one, depth, is a PIL image that visualizes the depth estimation result.
Let's take a look at the visualized result:

predictions["depth"]

Depth estimation inference by hand
Now that you've seen how to use the depth estimation pipeline, let's see how we can replicate the same result by hand.
Start by loading the model and associated processor from a checkpoint on the Hugging Face Hub.
Here we'll use the same check
