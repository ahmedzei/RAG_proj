point as before:

from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, AutoModelForDepthEstimation
checkpoint = "vinvino02/glpn-nyu"
image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
model = AutoModelForDepthEstimation.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

Prepare the image input for the model using the image_processor that will take care of the necessary image transformations
such as resizing and normalization:

pixel_values = image_processor(image, return_tensors="pt").pixel_values

Pass the prepared inputs
