nsformer encoder
with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE
benchmark, but trains 80% faster on GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths. At longer input lengths,
our FNet model is significantly faster: when compared to the "efficient" Transformers on the Long Range Arena
benchmark, FNet matches the accuracy of the most accurate models, while outpacing the fastest models across all
sequence lengths on GPUs (and across
