ter than the BERT model. The abstract from the
paper is the following:
We show that Transformer encoder architectures can be sped up, with limited accuracy costs, by replacing the
self-attention sublayers with simple linear transformations that "mix" input tokens. These linear mixers, along with
standard nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, prove competent at modeling semantic relationships in several text
classification tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Tra
