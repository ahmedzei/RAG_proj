A
gives a nice example of how this can be done.
However, if the original code-base is very complex or only allows intermediate components to be run in a compiled mode,
it might be too time-consuming or even impossible to separate the model into smaller testable sub-components. A good
example is T5's MeshTensorFlow library which is
very complex and does not offer a simple way to decompose the model into its sub-components. For such libraries, one
often relies on verifying print statements.
