del_pointer.weight.data = torch.from_numpy(pretrained_weight)

While doing so, you must verify that each randomly initialized weight of your PyTorch model and its corresponding
pretrained checkpoint weight exactly match in both shape and name. To do so, it is necessary to add assert
statements for the shape and print out the names of the checkpoints weights. E.g. you should add statements like:
python
assert (
    model_pointer.weight.shape == pretrained_weight.shape
), f"Pointer shape of random weight {mod
