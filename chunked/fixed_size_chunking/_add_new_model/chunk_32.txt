 to choose from:

Decompose the original model into many small testable components and run a forward pass on each of those for
  verification
Decompose the original model only into the original tokenizer and the original model, run a forward pass on
  those, and use intermediate print statements or breakpoints for verification

Again, it is up to you which strategy to choose. Often, one or the other is advantageous depending on the original code
base.
If the original code-base allows you to decompose the mo
