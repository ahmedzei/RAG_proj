e layer weights and define layer names. In PyTorch, the
name of a layer is defined by the name of the class attribute you give the layer. Let's define a dummy model in
PyTorch, called SimpleModel as follows:
thon
from torch import nn
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def init(self):
        super().init()
        self.dense = nn.Linear(10, 10)
        self.intermediate = nn.Linear(10, 10)
        self.layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(10)

Now we can create an instance of this model definition which will fill all w
