  running the forward pass, e.g. check-out this link.
Use the smallest pretrained checkpoint you can find. The smaller the checkpoint, the faster your debug cycle

  In case only very large checkpoints are available, it might make more sense to create a dummy model in the new
  environment with randomly initialized weights and save those weights for comparison with the ðŸ¤— Tra
