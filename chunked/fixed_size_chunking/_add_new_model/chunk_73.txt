The final part to make sure the ðŸ¤— Transformers implementation works correctly is to ensure that the outputs are
equivalent to a precision of 1e-3. First, you should ensure that the output shapes are identical, i.e.
outputs.shape should yield the same value for the script of the ðŸ¤— Transformers implementation and the original
implementation. Next, you should make sure that the output values are identical as well. This one of the most difficult
parts of adding a new model. Common mistakes why th
