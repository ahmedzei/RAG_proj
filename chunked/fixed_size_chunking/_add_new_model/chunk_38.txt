We expect that every model added to ðŸ¤— Transformers passes a couple of integration tests, meaning that the original
model and the reimplemented version in ðŸ¤— Transformers have to give the exact same output up to a precision of 0.001!
Since it is normal that the exact same model written in different libraries can give a slightly different output
depending on the libra
