odeling_brand_new_bert.py will either have the same architecture as BERT if
it's an encoder-only model or BART if it's an encoder-decoder model. At this point, you should remind yourself what
you've learned in the beginning about the theoretical aspects of the model: How is the model different from BERT or
BART?". Implement those changes which often means changing the self-attention layer, the order of the normalization
layer, etcâ€¦ Again, it is often useful to look at the similar architecture of already exi
