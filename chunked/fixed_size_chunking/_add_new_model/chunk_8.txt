in its forward pass to keep the level of abstraction low. Every new model requires a
configuration class, called BrandNewBertConfig. This configuration is always stored as an attribute in
[PreTrainedModel], and thus can be accessed via the config attribute for all classes
inheriting from BrandNewBertPreTrainedModel:
python
model = BrandNewBertModel.from_pretrained("brandy/brand_new_bert")
model.config  # model has access to its config
Similar to the model, the configuration inherits basic serialization and
