nal repository shows examples where
  you have to input a string, then try to find out where in the forward call the string input is changed to input ids
  and start from this point. This might mean that you have to possibly write a small script yourself or change the
  original code so that you can directly input the ids instead of an input string.
Make sure that the model in your debugging setup is not in training mode, which often causes the model to yield
  random outputs due to multiple dropout layers
