pip install -e ".[dev]"
Depending on your OS, and since the number of optional dependencies of Transformers is growing, you might get a
failure with this command. If that's the case make sure to install the Deep Learning framework you are working with
(PyTorch, TensorFlow and/or Flax) then do:

pip install -e ".[quality]"
which should be enough for most use cases. You can then return to the parent directory

cd ..

We recommend adding the PyTorch version of brand_new_bert to Transformers
