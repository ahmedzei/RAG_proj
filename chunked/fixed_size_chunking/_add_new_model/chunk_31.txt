For each code-base, a good first step is always to load a small pretrained checkpoint and to be able to reproduce a
single forward pass using a dummy integer vector of input IDs as an input. Such a script could look like this (in
pseudocode):
python
model = BrandNewBertModel.load_pretrained_checkpoint("/path/to/checkpoint/")
input_ids = [0, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7, 9]  # vector of input ids
original_output = model.predict(input_ids)
Next, regarding the debugging strategy, there are generally a few from which
