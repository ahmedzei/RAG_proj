uce a new
sentiment analysis task for the e-commerce domain, named Allegro Reviews (AR). To ensure a common evaluation scheme and
promote models that generalize to different NLU tasks, the benchmark includes datasets from varying domains and
applications. Additionally, we release HerBERT, a Transformer-based model trained specifically for the Polish language,
which has the best average performance and obtains the best results for three out of nine tasks. Finally, we provide an
extensive evaluation, includin
