Train a TensorFlow model with Keras
You can also train ðŸ¤— Transformers models in TensorFlow with the Keras API!
Loading data for Keras
When you want to train a ðŸ¤— Transformers model with the Keras API, you need to convert your dataset to a format that
Keras understands. If your dataset is small, you can just convert the whole thing to NumPy arrays and pass it to Keras.
Let's try that first before we do anything more complicated.
First, load a dataset. We'll use the CoLA dataset fr
