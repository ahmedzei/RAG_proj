om the GLUE benchmark,
since it's a simple binary text classification task, and just take the training split for now.

from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("glue", "cola")
dataset = dataset["train"]  # Just take the training split for now

Next, load a tokenizer and tokenize the data as NumPy arrays. Note that the labels are already a list of 0 and 1s,
so we can just convert that directly to a NumPy array without tokenization!

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoToken
