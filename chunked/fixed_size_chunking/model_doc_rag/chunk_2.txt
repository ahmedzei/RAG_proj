e-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind
task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge
remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit nonparametric
memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a
general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) â€” models which combine pre-trained
