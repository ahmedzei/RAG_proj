Overview
Retrieval-augmented generation ("RAG") models combine the powers of pretrained dense retrieval (DPR) and
sequence-to-sequence models. RAG models retrieve documents, pass them to a seq2seq model, then marginalize to generate
outputs. The retriever and seq2seq modules are initialized from pretrained models, and fine-tuned jointly, allowing
both retrieval and generation to adapt to downstream tasks.
It is based on the paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks by Patr
