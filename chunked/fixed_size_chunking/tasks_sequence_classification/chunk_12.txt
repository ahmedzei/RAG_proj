Once training is completed, share your model to the Hub with the [~transformers.Trainer.push_to_hub] method so everyone can use your model:

If you aren't familiar with finetuning a model with Keras, take a look at the basic tutorial here!

To finetune a model in TensorFlow, start by setting up an optimizer function, learning rate schedule, and some training hyperparameters:

from transformers import create_optimizer
import tensorflow as tf
batch_siz
