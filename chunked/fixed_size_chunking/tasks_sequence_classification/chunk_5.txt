he preprocessing function over the entire dataset, use ðŸ¤— Datasets [~datasets.Dataset.map] function. You can speed up map by setting batched=True to process multiple elements of the dataset at once:
py
tokenized_imdb = imdb.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
Now create a batch of examples using [DataCollatorWithPadding]. It's more efficient to dynamically pad the sentences to the longest length in a batch during collation, instead of padding the whole dataset to the maximum length.
