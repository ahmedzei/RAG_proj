Finally, you're ready to start training your model! Call fit with your training and validation datasets, the number of epochs, and your callbacks to finetune the model:

model.fit(x=tf_train_set, validation_data=tf_validation_set, epochs=3, callbacks=callbacks)

Once training is completed, your model is automatically uploaded to the Hub so everyone can use it!

For a more in-depth example of how to finetune a model for text classification, take a look at the corresponding
