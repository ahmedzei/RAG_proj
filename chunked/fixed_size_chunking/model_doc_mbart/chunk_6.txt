languages.
According to the abstract
Multilingual translation models can be created through multilingual finetuning. Instead of finetuning on one
direction, a pretrained model is finetuned on many directions at the same time. It demonstrates that pretrained models
can be extended to incorporate additional languages without loss of performance. Multilingual finetuning improves on
average 1 BLEU over the strongest baselines (being either multil
