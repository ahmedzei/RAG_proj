MBart and MBart-50

Overview of MBart
The MBart model was presented in Multilingual Denoising Pre-training for Neural Machine Translation by Yinhan Liu, Jiatao Gu, Naman Goyal, Xian Li, Sergey Edunov Marjan
Ghazvininejad, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer.
According to the abstract, MBART is a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pretrained on large-scale monolingual
corpora in many languages using the BART objective. mBART is one of the first methods for pretraining a complete
sequence-to-sequence model
