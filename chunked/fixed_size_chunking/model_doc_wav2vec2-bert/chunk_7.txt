ion of the audio instead of the raw waveform.
Wav2Vec2-BERT can use either no relative position embeddings, Shaw-like position embeddings, Transformer-XL-like position embeddings, or
  rotary position embeddings by setting the correct config.position_embeddings_type.
Wav2Vec2-BERT also introduces a Conformer-based adapter network instead of a simple convolutional network.
