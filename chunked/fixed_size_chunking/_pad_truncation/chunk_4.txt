 the max_length argument or the maximum
    length accepted by the model if no max_length is provided (max_length=None). This will only truncate
    the first sentence of a pair if a pair of sequences (or a batch of pairs of sequences) is provided.
False or 'do_not_truncate': no truncation is applied. This is the default behavior.

The max_length argument controls the length of the padding and truncation. It can be an integer or None, in which case it will default to the maximum length the model can accept.
