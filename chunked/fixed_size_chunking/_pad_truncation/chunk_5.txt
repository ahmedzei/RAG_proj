 If the model has no specific maximum input length, truncation or padding to max_length is deactivated.
The following table summarizes the recommended way to setup padding and truncation. If you use pairs of input sequences in any of the following examples, you can replace truncation=True by a STRATEGY selected in
['only_first', 'only_second', 'longest_first'], i.e. truncation='only_second' or truncation='longest_first' to control how both sequences in the pair are truncated as detailed before.
