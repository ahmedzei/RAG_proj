+ that can be executed multiple times
in parallel on a GPU.
The kernels provide a fast_hash function, which approximates the random projections of the queries and keys using the Fast Hadamard Transform. Using these
hash codes, the lsh_cumulation function approximates self-attention via LSH-based Bernoulli sampling.
To use the custom kernels, the user should set config.use_expectation = False. To ensure that the kernels are compiled successfully, 
the user must install the correct version of PyTorch and cuda
