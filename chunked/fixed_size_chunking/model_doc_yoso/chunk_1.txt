sed in natural language processing (NLP). Central to the transformer model is 
the self-attention mechanism, which captures the interactions of token pairs in the input sequences and depends quadratically 
on the sequence length. Training such models on longer sequences is expensive. In this paper, we show that a Bernoulli sampling 
attention mechanism based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), decreases the quadratic complexity of such models to linear. 
We bypass the quadratic cost by considering self-att
