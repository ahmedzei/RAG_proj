follows:
thon
from PIL import Image
image = Image.open(
    "name_of_your_document - can be a png, jpg, etc. of your documents (PDFs must be converted to images)."
)
width, height = image.size

However, this model includes a brand new [~transformers.LayoutLMv2Processor] which can be used to directly
prepare data for the model (including applying OCR under the hood). More information can be found in the "Usage"
