cr set to False.
In total, there are 5 use cases that are supported by the processor. Below, we list them all. Note that each of these
use cases work for both batched and non-batched inputs (we illustrate them for non-batched inputs).
Use case 1: document image classification (training, inference) + token classification (inference), apply_ocr =
True
This is the simplest case, in which the processor (actually the image processor) will perform OCR on the image to get
the words and normalized bounding boxes.
