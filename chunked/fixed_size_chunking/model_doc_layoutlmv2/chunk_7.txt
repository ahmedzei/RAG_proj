. The image input corresponds to the original document image in which the text
  tokens occur. The model expects each document image to be of size 224x224. This means that if you have a batch of
  document images, image should be a tensor of shape (batch_size, 3, 224, 224). This can be either a
  torch.Tensor or a Detectron2.structures.ImageList. You don't need to normalize the channels, as this is
  done by the model. Important to note is that the visual backbone expects BGR channels instead of RGB, as all
