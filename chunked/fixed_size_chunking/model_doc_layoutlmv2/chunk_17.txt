processor = LayoutLMv2Processor(image_processor, tokenizer)

In short, one can provide a document image (and possibly additional data) to [LayoutLMv2Processor],
and it will create the inputs expected by the model. Internally, the processor first uses
[LayoutLMv2ImageProcessor] to apply OCR on the image to get a list of words and normalized
bounding boxes, as well to resize the image to a given size in order to get the image input. The words and
normalized bounding boxes are then provided to [LayoutLMv2To
