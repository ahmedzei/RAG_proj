in a multi-modal framework, where new model
architectures and pre-training tasks are leveraged. Specifically, LayoutLMv2 not only uses the existing masked
visual-language modeling task but also the new text-image alignment and text-image matching tasks in the pre-training
stage, where cross-modality interaction is better learned. Meanwhile, it also integrates a spatial-aware self-attention
mechanism into the Transformer architecture, so that the model can fully understand the relative positional
