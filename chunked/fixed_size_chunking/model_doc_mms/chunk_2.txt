omatic speech recognition model for 1,107 languages, speech synthesis models 
for the same number of languages, as well as a language identification model for 4,017 languages. 
Experiments show that our multilingual speech recognition model more than halves the word error rate of 
Whisper on 54 languages of the FLEURS benchmark while being trained on a small fraction of the labeled data.
Here are the different models open sourced in the MMS project. The models and code are originally released here. We have
