e model. Hence, the model is agnostic to casing and punctuation, so these should be avoided in the text prompt. You can disable normalisation by setting normalize=False in the call to the tokenizer, but this will lead to un-expected behaviour and is discouraged.
The speaking rate can be varied by setting the attribute model.speaking_rate to a chosen value. Likewise, the randomness of the noise is controlled by model.noise_scale:
