add them to the transformers framework, making them easier to use.
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
The ASR model checkpoints  can be found here : mms-1b-fl102, mms-1b-l1107, mms-1b-all. For best accuracy, use the mms-1b-all model. 
Tips:

All ASR models accept a float array corresponding to the raw waveform of the speech signal. The raw waveform should be pre-processed with [Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor].
The models were trained using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) so the model output has to be
