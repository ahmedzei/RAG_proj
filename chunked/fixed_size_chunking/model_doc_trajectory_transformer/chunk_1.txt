paper is the following:
Reinforcement learning (RL) is typically concerned with estimating stationary policies or single-step models,
leveraging the Markov property to factorize problems in time. However, we can also view RL as a generic sequence
modeling problem, with the goal being to produce a sequence of actions that leads to a sequence of high rewards.
Viewed in this way, it is tempting to consider whether high-capacity sequence prediction models that work well
in other domains, such as natural-languag
