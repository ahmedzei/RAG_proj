*We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy
and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures,
which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive
literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps
with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate posi
