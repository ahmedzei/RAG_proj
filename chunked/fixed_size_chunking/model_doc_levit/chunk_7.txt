el] or [LevitForImageClassification].
  Techniques like data augmentation, optimization, and regularization were used in order to simulate training on a much larger dataset
  (while only using ImageNet-1k for pre-training). The 5 variants available are (all trained on images of size 224x224):
  facebook/levit-128S, facebook/levit-128, facebook/levit-192, facebook/levit-256 and
  facebook/levit-384. Note that one should use [LevitImageProcessor] in order to
  prepare images for the model.
