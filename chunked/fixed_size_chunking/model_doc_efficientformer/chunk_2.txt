chitecture search or hybrid design with MobileNet block, yet the inference speed is still 
unsatisfactory. This leads to an important question: can transformers run as fast as MobileNet while obtaining high performance? 
To answer this, we first revisit the network architecture and operators used in ViT-based models and identify inefficient designs. 
Then we introduce a dimension-consistent pure transformer (without MobileNet blocks) as a design paradigm. 
Finally, we perform latency-driven slimming to get
