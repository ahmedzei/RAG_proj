apid progress in computer vision tasks, achieving promising results on various benchmarks. 
However, due to the massive number of parameters and model design, e.g., attention mechanism, ViT-based models are generally 
times slower than lightweight convolutional networks. Therefore, the deployment of ViT for real-time applications is particularly 
challenging, especially on resource-constrained hardware such as mobile devices. Recent efforts try to reduce the computation 
complexity of ViT through network ar
