The outputs object is a [~modeling_outputs.SequenceClassifierOutput], as we can see in the
documentation of that class below, it means it has an optional loss, a logits, an optional hidden_states and
an optional attentions attribute. Here we have the loss since we passed along labels, but we don't have
hidden_states and attentions because
