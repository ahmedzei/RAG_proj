Graphormer
Overview
The Graphormer model was proposed in Do Transformers Really Perform Bad for Graph Representation?  by 
Chengxuan Ying, Tianle Cai, Shengjie Luo, Shuxin Zheng, Guolin Ke, Di He, Yanming Shen and Tie-Yan Liu. It is a Graph Transformer model, modified to allow computations on graphs instead of text sequences by generating embeddings and features of interest during preprocessing and collation, then using a modified attention.
