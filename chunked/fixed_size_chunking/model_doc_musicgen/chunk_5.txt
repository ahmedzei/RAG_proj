Generation
MusicGen is compatible with two generation modes: greedy and sampling. In practice, sampling leads to significantly
better results than greedy, thus we encourage sampling mode to be used where possible. Sampling is enabled by default,
and can be explicitly specified by setting do_sample=True in the call to [MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.generate],
or by overriding the model's generation config (see below).
Generation is limited by the sinusoidal positional embeddings to 30 second
