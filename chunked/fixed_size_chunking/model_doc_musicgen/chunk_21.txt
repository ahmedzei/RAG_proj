Gen decoder [MusicgenForCausalLM]
can be trained standalone on a dataset of encoder hidden-states and audio codes. For inference, the trained decoder can
be combined with the frozen text encoder and audio encoder/decoders to recover the composite [MusicgenForConditionalGeneration]
model.
Tips:
* MusicGen is trained on the 32kHz checkpoint of Encodec. You should ensure you use a compatible version of the Encodec model.
* Sampling mode tends to deliver better results than greedy - you can toggle sampling with
