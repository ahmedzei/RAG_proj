llowing this approach, we demonstrate how MusicGen
can generate high-quality samples, while being conditioned on textual description or melodic features, allowing better
controls over the generated output. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation, considering both automatic and human
studies, showing the proposed approach is superior to the evaluated baselines on a standard text-to-music benchmark.
Through ablation studies, we shed light over the importance of each of the components comprising MusicGen.
