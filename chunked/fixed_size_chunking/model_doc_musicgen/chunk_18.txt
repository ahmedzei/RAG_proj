Text encoder: maps the text inputs to a sequence of hidden-state representations. The pre-trained MusicGen models use a frozen text encoder from either T5 or Flan-T5
2. MusicGen decoder: a language model (LM) that auto-regressively generates audio tokens (or codes) conditional on the encoder hidden-state representations
3. Audio encoder/decoder: used to encode an audio prompt to use as prompt tokens, and recover the audio waveform from the audio tokens predicted by the decoder
Thus, the MusicGen model can e
