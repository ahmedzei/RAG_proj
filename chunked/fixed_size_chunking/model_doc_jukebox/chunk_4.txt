emory to train. Feel free to open a PR and add what's missing to have a full integration with the hugging face trainer!
This model is very slow, and takes 8h to generate a minute long audio using the 5b top prior on a V100 GPU. In order automaticallay handle the device on which the model should execute, use accelerate.
Contrary to the paper, the order of the priors goes from 0 to 1 as it felt more intuitive : we sample starting from 0.
Primed sampling (conditioning the sampling on raw audio) requires more m
