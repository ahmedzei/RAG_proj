orts into plain transformers, hierarchical transformers have
also gained significant attention, thanks to their performance and easy integration into existing frameworks.
These models typically employ localized attention mechanisms, such as the sliding-window Neighborhood Attention (NA)
or Swin Transformer's Shifted Window Self Attention. While effective at reducing self attention's quadratic complexity,
local attention weakens two of the most desirable properties of self attention: long range inter-depende
