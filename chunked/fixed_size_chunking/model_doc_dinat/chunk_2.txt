ncy modeling,
and global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and
efficient extension to NA that can capture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no
additional cost. NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention complement each other, and therefore we
introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon both.
DiNAT variants enjoy significant impro
