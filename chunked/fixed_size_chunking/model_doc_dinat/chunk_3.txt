vements over strong baselines such as NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt.
Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin counterpart by 1.5% box AP in COCO object detection,
1.3% mask AP in COCO instance segmentation, and 1.1% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation.
Paired with new frameworks, our large variant is the new state of the art panoptic segmentation model on COCO (58.2 PQ)
and ADE20K (48.5 PQ), and instance segmentation model on Cityscapes (44.5 AP) and ADE20K (35.4 AP) (no extra data).
It also matches the s
