EnCodec
Overview
The EnCodec neural codec model was proposed in High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression by Alexandre DÃ©fossez, Jade Copet, Gabriel Synnaeve, Yossi Adi.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We introduce a state-of-the-art real-time, high-fidelity, audio codec leveraging neural networks. It consists in a streaming encoder-decoder architecture with quantized latent space trained in an end-to-end fashion. We simplify and speed-up the training by using a single multiscale spectrogram adv
