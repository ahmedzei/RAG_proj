Usage tips

WavLM is a speech model that accepts a float array corresponding to the raw waveform of the speech signal. Please use
  [Wav2Vec2Processor] for the feature extraction.
WavLM model can be fine-tuned using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) so the model output has to be decoded
  using [Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer].
