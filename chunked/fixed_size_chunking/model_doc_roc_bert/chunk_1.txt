nguages like Chinese. In this work, we propose
ROCBERT: a pretrained Chinese Bert that is robust to various forms of adversarial attacks like word perturbation,
synonyms, typos, etc. It is pretrained with the contrastive learning objective which maximizes the label consistency
under different synthesized adversarial examples. The model takes as input multimodal information including the
semantic, phonetic and visual features. We show all these features are important to the model robustness since the
