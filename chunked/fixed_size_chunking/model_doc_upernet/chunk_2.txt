m images. The trained networks are further applied to discover visual knowledge in natural scenes.

 UPerNet framework. Taken from the original paper. 
This model was contributed by nielsr. The original code is based on OpenMMLab's mmsegmentation here.
Usage examples
UPerNet is a general framework for semantic segmentation. It can be used with any vision backbone, like so:

from transformers import SwinConfig, UperNetConfig, UperNetForSemanticSegmentation
backbone_config = SwinConfig(out_features=["stage1",
