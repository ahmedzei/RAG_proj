ble. Our models and loss functions generally obey rule #1 and #2 by default, so you can skip over them if you’re using transformers models. Don’t forget about these rules when writing your own models and loss functions, though!

XLA Rule #1: Your code cannot have “data-dependent conditionals”

python
if tf.reduce_sum(tensor) > 10:
    tensor = tensor / 2.0
