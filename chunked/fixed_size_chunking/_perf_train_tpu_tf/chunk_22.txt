e a TPU-compatible dataset loading approach (see notebook)
Migrate your code either to Colab (with accelerator set to “TPU”) or a TPU VM on Google Cloud
Add TPU initializer code (see notebook)
Create your TPUStrategy and make sure dataset loading and model creation are inside the strategy.scope() (see notebook)
Don’t forget to take jit_compile=True out again when you move to TPU!

Call model.fit()
You did it!
