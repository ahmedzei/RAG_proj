s encoder but also
its decoder is pretrained. In addition to discriminative tasks from the FLUE benchmark, we evaluate BARThez on a novel
summarization dataset, OrangeSum, that we release with this paper. We also continue the pretraining of an already
pretrained multilingual BART on BARThez's corpus, and we show that the resulting model, which we call mBARTHez,
provides a significant boost over vanilla BARThez, and is on par with or outperforms CamemBERT and FlauBERT.
