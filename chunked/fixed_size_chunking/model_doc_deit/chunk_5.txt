of the distillation token. In that case, the [CLS] prediction
  head is trained using regular cross-entropy between the prediction of the head and the ground-truth label, while the
  distillation prediction head is trained using hard distillation (cross-entropy between the prediction of the
  distillation head and the label predicted by the teacher). At inference time, one takes the average prediction
  between both heads as final prediction. (2) is also called "fine-tuning with distillation", because one r
