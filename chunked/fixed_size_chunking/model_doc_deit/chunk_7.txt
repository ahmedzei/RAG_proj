geNet-1k only. No external data was used. This is in
  contrast with the original ViT model, which used external data like the JFT-300M dataset/Imagenet-21k for
  pre-training.
The authors of DeiT also released more efficiently trained ViT models, which you can directly plug into
  [ViTModel] or [ViTForImageClassification]. Techniques like data
  augmentation, optimization, and regularization were used in order to simulate training on a much larger dataset
  (while only using ImageNet-1k for pre-training).
