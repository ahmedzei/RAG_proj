DeiT
Overview
The DeiT model was proposed in Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention by Hugo Touvron, Matthieu Cord, Matthijs Douze, Francisco Massa, Alexandre
Sablayrolles, Hervé Jégou. The Vision Transformer (ViT) introduced in Dosovitskiy et al., 2020 has shown that one can match or even outperform existing convolutional neural
networks using a Transformer encoder (BERT-like). However, the ViT models introduced in that paper required training on
expensive infrastructu
