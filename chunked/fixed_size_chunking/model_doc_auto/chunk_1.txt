retrained("google-bert/bert-base-cased")
will create a model that is an instance of [BertModel].
There is one class of AutoModel for each task, and for each backend (PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Flax).
Extending the Auto Classes
Each of the auto classes has a method to be extended with your custom classes. For instance, if you have defined a
custom class of model NewModel, make sure you have a NewModelConfig then you can add those to the auto
classes like this:
thon
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModel
