sec bandwidth in each direction, and 112.5 GB/sec total bandwidth
between two GPUs. Two RTX 3090 GPUs can be connected together for SLI using NVLink.
(Note that 3-Way and 4-Way SLI configurations are not supported.)

So the higher X you get in the report of NVX in the output of nvidia-smi topo -m the better. The generation will depend on your GPU architecture.
Let's compare the execution of a openai-community/gpt2 language model training over a small sample of wikitext.
The results are:
| NVlink | Time |
