 connectivity becomes super important to achieve faster training.
NVlink
NVLink is a wire-based serial multi-lane near-range communications link developed by Nvidia.
Each new generation provides a faster bandwidth, e.g. here is a quote from Nvidia Ampere GA102 GPU Architecture:

Third-Generation NVLink®
GA102 GPUs utilize NVIDIA’s third-generation NVLink interface, which includes four x4 links,
with each link providing 14.0625 GB/sec bandwidth in each direction between two GPUs. Four
links provide 56.25 GB/
