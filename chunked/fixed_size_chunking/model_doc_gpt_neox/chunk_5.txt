d a model using Flash Attention 2, we can pass the argument attn_implementation="flash_attention_2" to .from_pretrained. We'll also load the model in half-precision (e.g. torch.float16), since it results in almost no degradation to audio quality but significantly lower memory usage and faster inference:
