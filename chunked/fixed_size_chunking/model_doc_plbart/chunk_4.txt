ext format is [tgt_lang_code] X [eos]. bos is never used.
However, for fine-tuning, in some cases no language token is provided in cases where a single language is used. Please refer to the paper to learn more about this.
In cases where the language code is needed, the regular [~PLBartTokenizer.__call__] will encode source text format 
when you pass texts as the first argument or with the keyword argument text, and will encode target text format if
it's passed with the text_target keyword argument.
