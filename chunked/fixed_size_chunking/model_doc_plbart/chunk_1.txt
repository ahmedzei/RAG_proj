ing language (PL) and natural language (NL),
while code translation avails the migration of legacy code from one PL to another. This paper introduces PLBART, 
a sequence-to-sequence model capable of performing a broad spectrum of program and language understanding and generation tasks.
PLBART is pre-trained on an extensive collection of Java and Python functions and associated NL text via denoising autoencoding.
