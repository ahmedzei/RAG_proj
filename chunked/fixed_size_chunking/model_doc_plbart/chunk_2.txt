 in seven programming languages
show that PLBART outperforms or rivals state-of-the-art models. Moreover, experiments on discriminative tasks, e.g., program
repair, clone detection, and vulnerable code detection, demonstrate PLBART's effectiveness in program understanding.
Furthermore, analysis reveals that PLBART learns program syntax, style (e.g., identifier naming convention), logical flow
(e.g., if block inside an else block is equivalent to else if block) that are crucial to program semantics and thus
