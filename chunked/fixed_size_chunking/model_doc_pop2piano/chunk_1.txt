Pop2Piano is an encoder-decoder Transformer model based on T5. The input audio 
is transformed to its waveform and passed to the encoder, which transforms it to a latent representation. The decoder 
uses these latent representations to generate token ids in an autoregressive way. Each token id corresponds to one of four 
different token types: time, velocity, note and 'special'. The token ids are then decoded to their equivalent MIDI file.
