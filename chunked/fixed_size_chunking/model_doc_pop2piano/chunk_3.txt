sent Pop2Piano, a Transformer network
that generates piano covers given waveforms of pop music. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first model to generate a piano cover
directly from pop audio without using melody and chord extraction
modules. We show that Pop2Piano, trained with our dataset, is capable
of producing plausible piano covers.
This model was contributed by Susnato Dhar.
The original code can be found here.
