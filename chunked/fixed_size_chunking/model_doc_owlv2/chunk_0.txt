OWLv2
Overview
OWLv2 was proposed in Scaling Open-Vocabulary Object Detection by Matthias Minderer, Alexey Gritsenko, Neil Houlsby. OWLv2 scales up OWL-ViT using self-training, which uses an existing detector to generate pseudo-box annotations on image-text pairs. This results in large gains over the previous state-of-the-art for zero-shot object detection.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Open-vocabulary object detection has benefited greatly from pretrained vision-language models, but is sti
