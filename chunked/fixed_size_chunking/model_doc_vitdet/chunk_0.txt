ViTDet
Overview
The ViTDet model was proposed in Exploring Plain Vision Transformer Backbones for Object Detection by Yanghao Li, Hanzi Mao, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He.
VitDet leverages the plain Vision Transformer for the task of object detection.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We explore the plain, non-hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as a backbone network for object detection. This design enables the original ViT architecture to be fine-tuned for object detection without needing to re
