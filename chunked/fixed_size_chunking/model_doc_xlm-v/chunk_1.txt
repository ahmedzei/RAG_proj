 languages.
As these models have increased in parameter count and depth, vocabulary size has remained largely unchanged.
This vocabulary bottleneck limits the representational capabilities of multilingual models like XLM-R.
In this paper, we introduce a new approach for scaling to very large multilingual vocabularies by
de-emphasizing token sharing between languages with little lexical overlap and assigning vocabulary capacity
to achieve sufficient coverage for each individual language. Tokenizations using
