prompts to ensure the optimal output is often called "prompt engineering". Prompt engineering is an 
iterative process that requires a fair amount of experimentation. Natural languages are much more flexible and expressive 
than programming languages, however, they can also introduce some ambiguity. At the same time, prompts in natural language 
are quite sensitive to changes. Even minor modifications in prompts can lead to wildly different outputs.
While there is no exact recipe for creating prompts to mat
