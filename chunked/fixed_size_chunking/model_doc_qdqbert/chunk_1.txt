meters and evaluate their choices on a wide range of neural network models for different application
domains, including vision, speech, and language. We focus on quantization techniques that are amenable to acceleration
by processors with high-throughput integer math pipelines. We also present a workflow for 8-bit quantization that is
able to maintain accuracy within 1% of the floating-point baseline on all networks studied, including models that are
more difficult to quantize, such as MobileNets and BERT-l
