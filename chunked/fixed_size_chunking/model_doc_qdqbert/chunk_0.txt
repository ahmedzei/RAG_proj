Overview
The QDQBERT model can be referenced in Integer Quantization for Deep Learning Inference: Principles and Empirical
Evaluation by Hao Wu, Patrick Judd, Xiaojie Zhang, Mikhail Isaev and Paulius
Micikevicius.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Quantization techniques can reduce the size of Deep Neural Networks and improve inference latency and throughput by
taking advantage of high throughput integer instructions. In this paper we review the mathematical aspects of
quantization para
