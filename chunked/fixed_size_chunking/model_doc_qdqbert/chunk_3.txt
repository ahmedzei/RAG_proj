A complete example of using QDQBERT model to perform Quatization Aware Training and Post Training Quantization for
  SQUAD task can be found at transformers/examples/research_projects/quantization-qdqbert/.

Set default quantizers
QDQBERT model adds fake quantization operations (pair of QuantizeLinear/DequantizeLinear ops) to BERT by
TensorQuantizer in Pytorch Quantization Toolkit. TensorQuantizer is the module
for quantiz
