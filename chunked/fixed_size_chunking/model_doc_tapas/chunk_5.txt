rs have further pre-trained TAPAS to recognize table entailment, by creating a balanced dataset of millions of automatically created training examples which are learned in an intermediate step prior to fine-tuning. The authors of TAPAS call this further pre-training intermediate pre-training (since TAPAS is first pre-trained on MLM, and then on another dataset). They found that intermediate pre-training further improves performance on SQA, achieving a new state-of-the-art as well as state-of-the-art on TabF
