ive position embeddings by default (restarting the position embeddings at every cell of the table). Note that this is something that was added after the publication of the original TAPAS paper. According to the authors, this usually results in a slightly better performance, and allows you to encode longer sequences without running out of embeddings. This is reflected in the reset_position_index_per_cell parameter of [TapasConfig], which is set to True by default. The default versions of the models available
