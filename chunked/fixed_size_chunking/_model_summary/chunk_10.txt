ntexts to help it learn a deeper and richer representation of the inputs. However, there was still room for improvement in BERT's pretraining strategy. RoBERTa improved upon this by introducing a new pretraining recipe that includes training for longer and on larger batches, randomly masking tokens at each epoch instead of just once during preprocessing, and removing the next-sentence prediction objective. 
The dominant strategy to improve performance is to increase the model size. But training large models
