racter recognition (OCR) is a long-standing text recognition task that typically involves several components to understand the image and generate the text. TrOCR simplifies the process using an end-to-end Transformer. The encoder is a ViT-style model for image understanding and processes the image as fixed-size patches. The decoder accepts the encoder's hidden states and autoregressively generates text. Donut is a more general visual document understanding model that doesn't rely on OCR-based approaches. It
