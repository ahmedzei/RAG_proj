at LayoutXLM has its own tokenizer, based on
[LayoutXLMTokenizer]/[LayoutXLMTokenizerFast]. You can initialize it as
follows:
thon
from transformers import LayoutXLMTokenizer
tokenizer = LayoutXLMTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/layoutxlm-base")

Similar to LayoutLMv2, you can use [LayoutXLMProcessor] (which internally applies
[LayoutLMv2ImageProcessor] and
[LayoutXLMTokenizer]/[LayoutXLMTokenizerFast] in sequence) to prepare all
data for the model.

As LayoutXLM's architecture is equivalent to that of
