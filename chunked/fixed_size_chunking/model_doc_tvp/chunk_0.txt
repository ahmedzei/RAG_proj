TVP
Overview
The text-visual prompting (TVP) framework was proposed in the paper Text-Visual Prompting for Efficient 2D Temporal Video Grounding by Yimeng Zhang, Xin Chen, Jinghan Jia, Sijia Liu, Ke Ding.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
In this paper, we study the problem of temporal video grounding (TVG), which aims to predict the starting/ending time points of moments described by a text sentence within a long untrimmed video. Benefiting from fine-grained 3D visual features, the TVG techniq
