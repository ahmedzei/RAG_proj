del. These prompts provide additional spatial-temporal context, improving the model's ability to accurately determine event timings in the video. The approach employs 2D visual inputs in place of 3D ones. Although 3D inputs offer more spatial-temporal detail, they are also more time-consuming to process. The use of 2D inputs with the prompting method aims to provide similar levels of context and accuracy more efficiently.
