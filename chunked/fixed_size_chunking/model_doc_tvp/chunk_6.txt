pled video frames and textual features, respectively. Specially, a set of different visual prompts are applied to uniformly-sampled frames of one untrimmed video in order.
The goal of this model is to incorporate trainable prompts into both visual inputs and textual features to temporal video grounding(TVG) problems.
In principle, one can apply any visual, cross-modal encoder in the proposed architecture.
The [TvpProcessor] wraps [BertTokenizer] and [TvpImageProcessor] into a single instance to both
