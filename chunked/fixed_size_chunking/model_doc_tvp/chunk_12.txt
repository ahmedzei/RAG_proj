-1, perform random temporal sampling.
            If clip_idx is larger than -1, uniformly split the video to num_clips
            clips, and select the clip_idx-th video clip.
        num_clips (int): overall number of clips to uniformly sample from the given video.
        target_fps (int): the input video may have different fps, convert it to
            the target video fps before frame sampling.
    Returns:
        frames (tensor): decoded frames from the video.
