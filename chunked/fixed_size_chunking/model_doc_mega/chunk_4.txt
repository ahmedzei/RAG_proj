A as a decoder, be sure to set bidirectional=False to avoid errors with default bidirectional. 
Mega-chunk is a variant of mega that reduces time and spaces complexity from quadratic to linear. Utilize chunking with MegaConfig.use_chunking and control chunk size with MegaConfig.chunk_size 

Implementation Notes

The original implementation of MEGA had an inconsistent expectation of attention masks for padding and causal self-attention between the softmax attention and Laplace/squared ReLU method. This imple
