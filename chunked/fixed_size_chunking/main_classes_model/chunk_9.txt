d in the most optimal memory pattern, you can use the special value "auto",
and then dtype will be automatically derived from the model's weights:
python
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5", torch_dtype="auto")
Models instantiated from scratch can also be told which dtype to use with:
python
config = T5Config.from_pretrained("t5")
model = AutoModel.from_config(config)
Due to Pytorch design, this functionality is only available for floating dtypes.
