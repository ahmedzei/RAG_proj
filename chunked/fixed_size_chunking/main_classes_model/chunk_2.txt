In Transformers 4.20.0, the [~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained] method has been reworked to accommodate large models using Accelerate. This requires Accelerate >= 0.9.0 and PyTorch >= 1.9.0. Instead of creating the full model, then loading the pretrained weights inside it (which takes twice the size of the model in RAM, one for the randomly initialized model, one for the weights), there is an option to create the model as an empty shell, then only materialize its parameters when the pretrained weights ar
