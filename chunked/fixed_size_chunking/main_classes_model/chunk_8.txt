Model Instantiation dtype
Under Pytorch a model normally gets instantiated with torch.float32 format. This can be an issue if one tries to
load a model whose weights are in fp16, since it'd require twice as much memory. To overcome this limitation, you can
either explicitly pass the desired dtype using torch_dtype argument:
python
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
or, if you want the model to always loa
