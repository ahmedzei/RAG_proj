Models
The base classes [PreTrainedModel], [TFPreTrainedModel], and
[FlaxPreTrainedModel] implement the common methods for loading/saving a model either from a local
file or directory, or from a pretrained model configuration provided by the library (downloaded from HuggingFace's AWS
S3 repository).
[PreTrainedModel] and [TFPreTrainedModel] also implement a few methods which
are common among all the models to:

resize the input token embeddings when new tokens are added to the vocabulary
prune the attentio
