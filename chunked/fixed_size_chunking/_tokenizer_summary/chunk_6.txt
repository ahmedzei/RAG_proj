s a very big vocabulary (the set of all unique words and tokens used). E.g., Transformer XL uses space and punctuation tokenization, resulting in a vocabulary size of 267,735!
Such a big vocabulary size forces the model to have an enormous embedding matrix as the input and output layer, which
causes both an increased memory and time complexity. In general, transformers models rarely have a vocabulary size
greater than 50,000, especially if they are pretrained only on a single language.
So if simple space an
