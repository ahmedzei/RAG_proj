Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)
Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) was introduced in Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units (Sennrich et
al., 2015). BPE relies on a pre-tokenizer that splits the training data into
words. Pretokenization can be as simple as space tokenization, e.g. GPT-2, RoBERTa. More advanced pre-tokenization include rule-based tokenization, e.g. XLM,
FlauBERT which uses Moses for most languages, or GPT which uses
spaCy and ftfy, t
