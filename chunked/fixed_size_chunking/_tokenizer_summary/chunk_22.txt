does not choose the most frequent
symbol pair, but the one that maximizes the likelihood of the training data once added to the vocabulary.
So what does this mean exactly? Referring to the previous example, maximizing the likelihood of the training data is
equivalent to finding the symbol pair, whose probability divided by the probabilities of its first symbol followed by
its second symbol is the greatest among all symbol pairs. E.g. "u", followed by "g" would have only been
merged if the probability of "ug
