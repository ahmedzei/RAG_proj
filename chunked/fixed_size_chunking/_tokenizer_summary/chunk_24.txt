ly trims down each
symbol to obtain a smaller vocabulary. The base vocabulary could for instance correspond to all pre-tokenized words and
the most common substrings. Unigram is not used directly for any of the models in the transformers, but it's used in
conjunction with SentencePiece.
At each training step, the Unigram algorithm defines a loss (often defined as the log-likelihood) over the training
data given the current vocabulary and a unigram language model. Then, for each symbol in the vocabulary, the
