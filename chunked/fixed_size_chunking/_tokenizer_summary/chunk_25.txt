 algorithm
computes how much the overall loss would increase if the symbol was to be removed from the vocabulary. Unigram then
removes p (with p usually being 10% or 20%) percent of the symbols whose loss increase is the lowest, i.e. those
symbols that least affect the overall loss over the training data. This process is repeated until the vocabulary has
reached the desired size. The Unigram algorithm always keeps the base characters so that any word can be tokenized.
Because Unigram is not based on merge r
