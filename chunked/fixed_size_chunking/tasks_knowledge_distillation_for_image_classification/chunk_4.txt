cher model (fine-tuned vision transformer). To achieve this, we first get the logits output from the teacher and the student. Then, we divide each of them by the parameter temperature which controls the importance of each soft target. A parameter called lambda weighs the importance of the distillation loss. In this example, we will use temperature=5 and lambda=0.5. We will use the Kullback-Leibler Divergence loss to compute the divergence between the student and teacher. Given two data P and Q, KL Divergenc
