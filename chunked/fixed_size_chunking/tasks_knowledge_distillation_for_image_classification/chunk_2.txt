In this example, we are using the merve/beans-vit-224 model as teacher model. It's an image classification model, based on google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k fine-tuned on beans dataset. We will distill this model to a randomly initialized MobileNetV2.
We will now load the dataset.

from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("beans")

We can use an image processor from either of the models, as in this case they return the same o
