forward] requires input_ids and bbox (bounding box). Each bounding box should be in (x0, y0, x1, y1) format (top-left corner, bottom-right corner). Obtaining of Bounding boxes depends on external OCR system. The x coordinate should be normalized by document image width, and the y coordinate should be normalized by document image height.
