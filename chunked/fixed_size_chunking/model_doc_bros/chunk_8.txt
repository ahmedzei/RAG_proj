[~transformers.BrosForTokenClassification.forward, ~transformers.BrosSpadeEEForTokenClassification.forward, ~transformers.BrosSpadeEEForTokenClassification.forward] require not only input_ids and bbox but also box_first_token_mask for loss calculation. It is a mask to filter out non-first tokens of each box. You can obtain this mask by saving start token indices of bounding boxes when creating input_ids from words. You can make box_first_token_mask with foll
