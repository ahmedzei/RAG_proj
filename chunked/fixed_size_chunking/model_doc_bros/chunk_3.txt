ForTokenClassification essentially perform the same job. However, BrosForTokenClassification assumes input tokens are perfectly serialized (which is very challenging task since they exist in a 2D space), while BrosSpadeEEForTokenClassification allows for more flexibility in handling serialization errors as it predicts next connection tokens from one token.
BrosSpadeELForTokenClassification perform the intra-entity linking task. It predicts relation from one token (of one entity) to another token (of another
