ZeRO Data Parallelism
ZeRO-powered data parallelism (ZeRO-DP) is illustrated in the following diagram from this blog post.

While it may appear complex, it is a very similar concept to DataParallel (DP). The difference is that instead of 
replicating the full model parameters, gradients and optimizer states, each GPU stores only a slice of it. Then, at 
run-time when the full layer parameters are needed just for the given layer, all
