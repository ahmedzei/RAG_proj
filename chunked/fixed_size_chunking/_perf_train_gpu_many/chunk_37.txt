re the bubble (idle time) is further minimized by prioritizing backward passes. Varuna further attempts to improve the 
schedule by using simulations to discover the most efficient scheduling.
OSLO has pipeline parallelism implementation based on the Transformers without nn.Sequential conversion.
Tensor Parallelism
In Tensor Parallelism, each GPU processes a slice of a tensor and only aggregates the full tensor for operations requiring it.
To describe this method, this section of the guide relies on the con
