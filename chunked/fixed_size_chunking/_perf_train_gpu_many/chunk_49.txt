Model Parallelism for Deep Neural Networks" by Zhihao Jia, Matei Zaharia, Alex Aiken
It performs a sort of 4D Parallelism over Sample-Operator-Attribute-Parameter.

Sample = Data Parallelism (sample-wise parallel)
Operator = Parallelize a single operation into several sub-operations
Attribute = Data Parallelism (length-wise parallel)
Parameter = Model Parallelism (regardless of dimension - horizontal or vertical)

Examples:
* Sample
Let's take 10 batches of sequence length 512. If we parallelize them by sam
