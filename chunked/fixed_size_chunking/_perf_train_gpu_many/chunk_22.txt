 tensor parallelism 
which will be discussed later. This is because it partitions/shards each layer's weights, unlike vertical model parallelism 
which is discussed next.
Implementations:

DeepSpeed ZeRO-DP stages 1+2+3
Accelerate integration 
transformers integration

From Naive Model Parallelism to Pipeline Parallelism
To explain Pipeline parallelism, we'll first look into Naive Model Parallelism (MP), also known as Vertical MP. This approach
involves distributing groups of model layers across multiple GP
