In this example, when data moves from layer 0 to 3, it's no different from regular forward pass. However, passing data 
from layer 3 to 4 requires moving it from GPU0 to GPU1, introducing a communication overhead. If the participating 
GPUs are on the same compute node (e.g. same physical machine) this copying is fast, but if the GPUs are distributed 
across different compute nodes (e.g. multiple
