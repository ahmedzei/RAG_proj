l to quadrupling the amount of memory of a single GPU, and ignoring the rest of the hardware. 
- Overhead in data transfer between devices:  E.g. 4x 6GB cards will be able to accommodate the same size as 1x 24GB card using naive MP, but a single 24GB card will complete the training faster, because it doesn't have the data copying overhead. But, say, if you have 40GB cards and need to fit a 45GB model you can with 4x 40GB cards (but barely because of the gradient and optimizer states)
- Copying shared embedd
