 because the last forward stage 
has to wait for backward to complete the pipeline. The purpose of finding the best value for chunks is to enable a high 
concurrent GPU utilization across all participating GPUs which translates to minimizing the size of the bubble.
Pipeline API solutions have been implemented in:
- PyTorch
- DeepSpeed
- Megatron-LM
These come with some shortcomings:
- They have to modify the model quite heavily, because Pipeline requires one to rewrite the normal flow of modules into a nn.S
