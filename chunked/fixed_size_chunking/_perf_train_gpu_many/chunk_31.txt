-batch at a time. To calculate the global batch size of the DP + PP setup, 
use the formula: mbs * chunks * dp_degree (8 * 32 * 4 = 1024).
With chunks=1 you end up with the naive MP, which is inefficient. With a large chunks value you end up with 
tiny micro-batch sizes which is also inefficient. For this reason, we encourage to experiment with the chunks value to 
find the one that leads to the most efficient GPUs utilization.
