ent variable was setup and you end up using the wrong GPUs. Instead, it is common practice to set the environment variable for a specific training run on the same command line.

CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER is an alternative environment variable you can use to control how the GPUs are ordered. You can either order them by:

PCIe bus ID's that matches the order of nvidia-smi and rocm-smi for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs respectively

export CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID

GPU compute ability

export CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=FASTEST_FIRS
