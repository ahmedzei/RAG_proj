ZeRO Data Parallelism + Pipeline Parallelism + Tensor Parallelism
One of the main features of DeepSpeed is ZeRO, which is a super-scalable extension of DP. It has already been 
discussed in ZeRO Data Parallelism. Normally it's a standalone feature that doesn't require PP or TP. 
But it can be combined with PP and TP.
When ZeRO-DP is combined with PP (and optionally TP) it typically enables only ZeRO stage 1 (opt
