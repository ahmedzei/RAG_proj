they have overcome the list of problems 
mentioned above and that they require smaller changes to the user's model.
Implementations:
- PyTorch (initial support in pytorch-1.8, and progressively getting improved in 1.9 and more so in 1.10). Some examples
- DeepSpeed
- Megatron-LM has an internal implementation - no API.
- Varuna
- SageMaker - this is a proprietary solution that can only be used on AWS.
- OSLO - this is implemented based on the Hugging Face Transformers.
