shows the naive MP on the top, and PP on the bottom:

At the bottom of the diagram, you can observe that the Pipeline Parallelism (PP) approach minimizes the number of idle 
GPU zones, referred to as 'bubbles'. Both parts of the diagram show a parallelism level of degree 4, meaning that 4 GPUs 
are involved in the pipeline. You can see that there's a forward path of 4 pipe stages (F0, F1, F2 and F3) followed by 
a backward path in reverse order (B3, B2, B1, and B0).
