ings: Shared embeddings may need to get copied back and forth between GPUs.
Now that you are familiar with how the naive approach to model parallelism works and its shortcomings, let's look at Pipeline Parallelism (PP).
PP is almost identical to a naive MP, but it solves the GPU idling problem by chunking the incoming batch into micro-batches 
and artificially creating a pipeline, which allows different GPUs to concurrently participate in the computation process.
The following illustration from the GPipe pa
