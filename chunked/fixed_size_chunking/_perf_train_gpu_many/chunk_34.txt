- Conditional control flow at the level of pipe stages is not possible - e.g., Encoder-Decoder models like T5 require special workarounds to handle a conditional encoder stage.
- They have to arrange each layer so that the output of one layer becomes an input to the other layer.
More recent solutions include:
- Varuna
- Sagemaker
We have not experimented with Varuna and SageMaker but their papers report that
