 path through the layer, but the GPU0 has only a0. 
It will get a1 from GPU1 and a2 from GPU2, bringing all the pieces of the model together.
In parallel, GPU1 gets another mini-batch - x1. GPU1 has the a1 parameter, but needs a0 and a2, so it gets those from GPU0 and GPU2.
Same happens to GPU2 that gets the mini-batch x2. It gets a0 and a1 from GPU0 and GPU1.
This way each of the 3 GPUs gets the full tensors reconstructed and makes a forward pass with its own mini-batch.
As soon as the calculation is done,
