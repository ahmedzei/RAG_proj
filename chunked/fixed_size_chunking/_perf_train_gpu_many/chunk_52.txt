or models with static and 
fixed workloads, since models with dynamic behavior may prefer different parallelization strategies across iterations.
So the promise is very attractive - it runs a 30min simulation on the cluster of choice and it comes up with the best 
strategy to utilise this specific environment. If you add/remove/replace any parts it'll run and re-optimize the plan 
for that. And then you can train. A different setup will have its own custom optimization.
