ide offers an in-depth overview of individual types of parallelism, as well as guidance on ways to combine 
techniques and choosing an appropriate approach. For step-by-step tutorials on distributed training, please refer to
the ðŸ¤— Accelerate documentation. 

While the main concepts discussed in this guide are likely applicable across frameworks, here we focus on 
PyTorch-based implementations.

Before diving deeper into the specifics of each technique, let's go over the rough decision process when training
