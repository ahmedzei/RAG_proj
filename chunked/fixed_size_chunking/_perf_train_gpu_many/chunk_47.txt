nimizing the Pipeline bubble (number of micro-batches). Therefore those communication costs are going to impact the performance.
In addition, there are already fewer layers than normal due to PP and so the memory savings won't be huge. PP already 
reduces gradient size by 1/PP, and so gradient sharding savings on top of that are less significant than pure DP.
ZeRO stage 3 is not a good choice either for the same reason - more inter-node communications required.
And since we have ZeRO, the other benefit is Z
