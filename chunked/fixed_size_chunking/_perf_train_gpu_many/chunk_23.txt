Us by assigning specific layers to specific GPUs with .to(). 
As data flows through these layers, it is moved to the same GPU as the layer, while the other layers remain untouched.
We refer to this Model parallelism as "Vertical" because of how models are typically visualized. For example, the 
following diagram shows an 8-layer model split vertically into two slices, placing layers 0-3 onto 
GPU0 and 4-7 to GPU1:

| Layer |      |
|   0   |      |
|   1   | GPU0 |
|   2   |      |
|   3   |      |
