the available GPUs, and you don't need Accelerate or the DeepSpeed integration.
Number of GPUs
For example, if you have 4 GPUs and you only want to use the first 2:

Use the --nproc_per_node to select how many GPUs to use.

torchrun --nproc_per_node=2  trainer-program.py 

Use --num_processes to select how many GPUs to use.

accelerate launch --num_processes 2 trainer-program.py 

Use --num_gpus to select how many GPUs to use.

deepspeed --num_gpus 2 trainer-program.py 

Order of GPUs
Now, to select which G
