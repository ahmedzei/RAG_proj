imizer sharding).
While it's theoretically possible to use ZeRO stage 2 (gradient sharding) with Pipeline Parallelism, it will have negative 
performance impacts. There would need to be an additional reduce-scatter collective for every micro-batch to aggregate 
the gradients before sharding, which adds a potentially significant communication overhead. By nature of Pipeline Parallelism, 
small micro-batches are used and instead the focus is on trying to balance arithmetic intensity (micro-batch size) with
mi
