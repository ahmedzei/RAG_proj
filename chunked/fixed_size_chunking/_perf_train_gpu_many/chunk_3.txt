Scalability strategy
Begin by estimating how much vRAM is required to train your model. For models hosted on the ðŸ¤— Hub, use our 
Model Memory Calculator, which gives you 
accurate calculations within a few percent margin.  
Parallelization strategy for a single Node / multi-GPU setup
When training a model on a single node with multiple GPUs, your choice of parallelization strategy can significantly 
impact performance. Here's a breakdown of your options:
