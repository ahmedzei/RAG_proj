 to as "Bort".
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We extract an optimal subset of architectural parameters for the BERT architecture from Devlin et al. (2018) by
applying recent breakthroughs in algorithms for neural architecture search. This optimal subset, which we refer to as
"Bort", is demonstrably smaller, having an effective (that is, not counting the embedding layer) size of 5.5% the
original BERT-large architecture, and 16% of the net size. Bort is also able to be pretrained in 288 GPU ho
