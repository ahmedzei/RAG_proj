ng torch.distributed to launch a distributed training, each process will load the pretrained model and store these two copies in RAM.

Note that the randomly created model is initialized with "empty" tensors, which take the space in memory without filling it (thus the random values are whatever was in this chunk of memory at a given time). The random initialization following the appropriate distribution for the kind of model/parameters instantiated (like a normal distribution for instance) is only performed
