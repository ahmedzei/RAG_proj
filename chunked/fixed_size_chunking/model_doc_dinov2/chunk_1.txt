Ov2 is an upgrade of DINO, a self-supervised method applied on Vision Transformers. This method enables all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
The recent breakthroughs in natural language processing for model pretraining on large quantities of data have opened the way for similar foundation models in computer vision. These models could greatly simplify the use of images in any system by prod
