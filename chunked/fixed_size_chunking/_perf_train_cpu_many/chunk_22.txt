kubectl create -f pytorchjob.yaml
The kubectl get pods -n kubeflow command can then be used to list the pods in the kubeflow namespace. You should see
the worker pods for the PyTorchJob that was just deployed. At first, they will probably have a status of "Pending" as
the containers get pulled and created, then the status should change to "Running".
