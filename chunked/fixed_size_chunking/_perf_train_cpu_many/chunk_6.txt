multi CPU distributed training in the Trainer with the ccl backend, users should add --ddp_backend ccl in the command arguments.
Let's see an example with the question-answering example
The following command enables training with 2 processes on one Xeon node, with one process running per one socket. The variables OMP_NUM_THREADS/CCL_WORKER_COUNT can be tuned for optimal performance.
shell script
 export CCL_WORKER_COUNT=1
 export MASTER_ADDR=127.0.0.1
 mpirun -n 2 -genv OMP_NUM_THREADS=23 \
 python3 run_qa.
