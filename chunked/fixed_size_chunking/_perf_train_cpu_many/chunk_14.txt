me mount for the PVC
The volume mount defines a path where the PVC will be mounted in the container for each worker pod. This location can be
used for the dataset, checkpoint files, and the saved model after training completes.
The snippet below is an example of a yaml file for a PyTorchJob with 4 workers running the
question-answering example.
yaml
apiVersion: "kubeflow.org/v1"
kind: PyTorchJob
metadata:
  name: transformers-pytorchjob
  namespace: kubeflow
spec:
  elasticPolicy:
    rdzvBackend: c10d
