rep torch to get your pytorch_version.

pip install oneccl_bind_pt=={pytorch_version} -f https://developer.intel.com/ipex-whl-stable-cpu
where {pytorch_version} should be your PyTorch version, for instance 2.1.0.
Check more approaches for oneccl_bind_pt installation.
Versions of oneCCL and PyTorch must match.

oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch 1.12.0 prebuilt wheel does not work with PyTorch 1.12.1 (it is for PyTorch 1.12.0)
PyTorch 1.12.1 should work with oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch 1.12.100
