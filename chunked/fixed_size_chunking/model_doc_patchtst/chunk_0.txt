PatchTST
Overview
The PatchTST model was proposed in A Time Series is Worth 64 Words: Long-term Forecasting with Transformers by Yuqi Nie, Nam H. Nguyen, Phanwadee Sinthong and Jayant Kalagnanam.
At a high level the model vectorizes time series into patches of a given size and encodes the resulting sequence of vectors via a Transformer that then outputs the prediction length forecast via an appropriate head. The model is illustrated in the following figure:
