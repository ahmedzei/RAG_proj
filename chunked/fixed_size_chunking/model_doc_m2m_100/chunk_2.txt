to effectively increase model capacity through a combination of dense scaling and language-specific sparse parameters
to create high quality models. Our focus on non-English-Centric models brings gains of more than 10 BLEU when directly
translating between non-English directions while performing competitively to the best single systems of WMT. We
open-source our scripts so that others may reproduce the data, evaluat
