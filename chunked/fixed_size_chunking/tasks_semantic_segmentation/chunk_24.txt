nstantiate a pretrained model.
3. Convert a ðŸ¤— Dataset to a tf.data.Dataset.
4. Compile your model.
5. Add callbacks to calculate metrics and upload your model to ðŸ¤— Hub
6. Use the fit() method to run the training.
Start by defining the hyperparameters, optimizer and learning rate schedule:

from transformers import create_optimizer
batch_size = 2
num_epochs = 50
num_train_steps = len(train_ds) * num_epochs
learning_rate = 6e-5
weight_decay_rate = 0.01
optimizer, lr_schedule = create_optimizer(
     init_lr=l
