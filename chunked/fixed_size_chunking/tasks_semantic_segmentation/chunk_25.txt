Then, load SegFormer with [TFAutoModelForSemanticSegmentation] along with the label mappings, and compile it with the
optimizer. Note that Transformers models all have a default task-relevant loss function, so you don't need to specify one unless you want to:

from transformers import TFAutoModelForSemanticSegmentation
model = TFAutoModelForSemanticSegmentation.from_pretrained(
