Congratulations! You have fine-tuned your model and shared it on the ðŸ¤— Hub. You can now use it for inference!

Inference
Great, now that you've finetuned a model, you can use it for inference!
Load an image for inference:

image = ds[0]["image"]

We will now see how to infer without a pipeline. Process the image with an image processor and place the pixel_values on a GPU:

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")  # use GPU if available, otherwis
