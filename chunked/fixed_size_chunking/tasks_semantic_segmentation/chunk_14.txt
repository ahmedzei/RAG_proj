To apply the preprocessing transformations over the entire dataset, use the ðŸ¤— Datasets [~datasets.Dataset.set_transform] function.
The transform is applied on the fly which is faster and consumes less disk space:

train_ds.set_transform(train_transforms)
test_ds.set_transform(val_transforms)

Evaluate
Including a metric during training is often helpful for evaluating your model's performance. You can quickly load an evaluation method with the ðŸ¤— Evaluate library
