: one that
extracts the hidden features from a batch of images (like [BertModel]) and one that is suitable for image
classification (like [BertForSequenceClassification]).
As we mentioned before, we'll only write a loose wrapper of the model to keep it simple for this example. The only
thing we need to do before writing this class is a map between the block types and actual block classes. Then the
model is defined from the configuration by passing everything to the ResNet class:
