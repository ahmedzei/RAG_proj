can use any of the methods of [PreTrainedModel], like [~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained] or
[~PreTrainedModel.push_to_hub]. We will use the second in the next section, and see how to push the model weights
with the code of our model. But first, let's load some pretrained weights inside our model.
In your own use case, you will probably be training your custom model on your own data. To go fast for this tutorial,
we will use the pretrained version of the resnet50d. Since our model is just a wrapper around it
