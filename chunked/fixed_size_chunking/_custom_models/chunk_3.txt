mpler code with a clear "source of truth" for any hyperparameters, and also makes it easier
to reuse code from other models in transformers.

In our example, we will take a couple of arguments of the ResNet class that we might want to tweak. Different
configurations will then give us the different types of ResNets that are possible. We then just store those arguments,
after checking the validity of a few of them.
