    return {"logits": logits}

In both cases, notice how we inherit from PreTrainedModel and call the superclass initialization with the config
(a bit like when you write a regular torch.nn.Module). The line that sets the config_class is not mandatory, unless
you want to register your model with the auto classes (see last section).

If your model is very similar to a model inside the library, you can re-use the same configuration as
