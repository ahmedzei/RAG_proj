You're ready to start training your model now! Load DistilBERT with [AutoModelForQuestionAnswering]:

from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, TrainingArguments, Trainer
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")

At this point, only three steps remain:

Define your training hyperparameters in [TrainingArguments]. The only required parameter is output_dir which specifies where to save your model. You'll push this model to the Hub
