The process depicted above is repeated iteratively until some stopping condition is reached. Ideally, the stopping condition is dictated by the model, which should learn when to output an end-of-sequence (EOS) token. If this is not the case, generation stops when some predefined maximum length is reached.
Properly setting up the token selection step and the stopping condition is essential to ma
