p to 20 tokens by default. We highly recommend manually setting max_new_tokens in your generate call to control the maximum number of new tokens it can return. Keep in mind LLMs (more precisely, decoder-only models) also return the input prompt as part of the output.

model_inputs = tokenizer(["A sequence of numbers: 1, 2"], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
By default, the output will contain up to 20 tokens
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tok
