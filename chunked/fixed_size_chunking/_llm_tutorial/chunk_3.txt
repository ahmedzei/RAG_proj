There are other ways to initialize a model, but this is a good baseline to begin with an LLM.
Next, you need to preprocess your text input with a tokenizer.

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1", padding_side="left")
model_inputs = tokenizer(["A list of colors: red, blue"], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

The model_inputs variable holds the tokenized text input, as well as the attention mask. While [~gener
