 a prompt you'd like to generate text from:

prompt = "Somatic hypermutation allows the immune system to"

The simplest way to try out your finetuned model for inference is to use it in a [pipeline]. Instantiate a pipeline for text generation with your model, and pass your text to it:

from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="username/my_awesome_eli5_clm-model")
generator(prompt)
[{'generated_text': "Somatic hypermutation allows the immune system to be able to effecti
