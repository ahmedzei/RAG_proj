ls (also known as an unsupervised task) because the next word is the label.
Preprocess

The next step is to load a DistilGPT2 tokenizer to process the text subfield:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilgpt2")

You'll notice from the example above, the text field is actually nested inside answers. This means you'll need to
extract the text subfield from its nested structure with the flatten method:

eli5 = eli5.flatten()
eli5["train"][0]
{'q_id'
