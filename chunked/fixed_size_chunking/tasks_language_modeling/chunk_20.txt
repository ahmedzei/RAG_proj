so you don't need to specify one unless you want to:

import tensorflow as tf
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)  # No loss argument!

This can be done by specifying where to push your model and tokenizer in the [~transformers.PushToHubCallback]:

from transformers.keras_callbacks import PushToHubCallback
callback = PushToHubCallback(
     output_dir="my_awesome_eli5_clm-model",
     tokenizer=tokenizer,
 )

Finally, you're ready to start training your model! Call fit with your training and validation datas
