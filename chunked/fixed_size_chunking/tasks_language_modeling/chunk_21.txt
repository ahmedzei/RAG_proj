ets, the number of epochs, and your callback to finetune the model:

model.fit(x=tf_train_set, validation_data=tf_test_set, epochs=3, callbacks=[callback])

Once training is completed, your model is automatically uploaded to the Hub so everyone can use it!

For a more in-depth example of how to finetune a model for causal language modeling, take a look at the corresponding
PyTorch notebook
or TensorFlow notebook.

Inference
Great, now that you've finetuned a model, you can use it for inference!
