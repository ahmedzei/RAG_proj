cifically, we developed a conditional compute model based on Sparsely Gated Mixture of
Experts that is trained on data obtained with novel and effective data mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages. We propose multiple architectural and training
improvements to counteract overfitting while training on thousands of tasks. Critically, we evaluated the performance of over 40,000 different translation directions using
a human-translated benchmark, Flores-200, and combined human evaluation with a n
