imilarity assessment, and document classification. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant,
labeled data for learning these specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to
perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pretraining of a
language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In
contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-awar
