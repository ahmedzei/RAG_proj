e input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve
effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms
discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task, significantly improving upon
the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied.
