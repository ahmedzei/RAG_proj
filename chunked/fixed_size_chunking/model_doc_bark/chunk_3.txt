Using CPU offload
As mentioned above, Bark is made up of 4 sub-models, which are called up sequentially during audio generation. In other words, while one sub-model is in use, the other sub-models are idle.
If you're using a CUDA device, a simple solution to benefit from an 80% reduction in memory footprint is to offload the submodels from GPU to CPU when they're
