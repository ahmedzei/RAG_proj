Performance comparison
The following diagram shows the latency for the native attention implementation (no optimisation) against Better Transformer and Flash Attention 2. In all cases, we generate 400 semantic tokens on a 40GB A100 GPU with PyTorch 2.1. Flash Attention 2 is also consistently faster than Better Transformer, and its performance improves even more as batch sizes increase:

To put this into perspective, on an NV
