del. It aims at predicting the first two audio codebooks necessary for EnCodec.
[BarkFineModel] (the 'fine acoustics' model), this time a non-causal autoencoder transformer, which iteratively predicts the last codebooks based on the sum of the previous codebooks embeddings.
having predicted all the codebook channels from the [EncodecModel], Bark uses it to decode the output audio array.

It should be noted that each of the first three modules can support conditional speaker embeddings to condition the outpu
