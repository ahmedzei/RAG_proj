The gradient accumulation method aims to calculate gradients in smaller increments instead of computing them for the 
entire batch at once. This approach involves iteratively calculating gradients in smaller batches by performing forward 
and backward passes through the model and accumulating the gradients during the process. Once a sufficient number of 
gradients have been accumulated, the model's optimization step is executed. By employing gradient accumulation, it 
becomes possible to increase the ef
