Note: when using mixed precision with a small model and a large batch size, there will be some memory savings but with a 
large model and a small batch size, the memory use will be larger.

You can combine the above methods to get a cumulative effect. These techniques are available to you whether you are 
training your model with [Trainer] or writing a pure PyTorch loop, in which case you can co
