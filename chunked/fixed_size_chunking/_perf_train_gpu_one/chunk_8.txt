ron counts and 
batch size for 
fully connected layers (which are involved in GEMMs (General Matrix Multiplications)).
Tensor Core Requirements 
define the multiplier based on the dtype and the hardware. For instance, for fp16 data type a multiple of 8 is recommended, unless 
it's an A100 GPU, in which case use multiples of 64.
For parameters that are small, consider also Dimension Quantization Effects. 
This is where tiling happens and the right multiplier can have a significant speedup.
