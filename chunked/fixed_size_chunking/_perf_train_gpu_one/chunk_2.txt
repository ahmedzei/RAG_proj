gradient accumulation, can help.
However, if the preferred batch size fits into memory, there's no reason to apply memory-optimizing techniques because they can 
slow down the training. Just because one can use a large batch size, does not necessarily mean they should. As part of 
hyperparameter tuning, you should determine which batch size yields the best results and then optimize resources accordingly.
The methods and tools covered in this guide can be classified based on the effect they have on the train
