 your model's performance. You can quickly load a evaluation method with the ðŸ¤— Evaluate library. For this task, load the accuracy metric (see the ðŸ¤— Evaluate quick tour to learn more about how to load and compute a metric):

import evaluate
accuracy = evaluate.load("accuracy")

Then create a function that passes your predictions and labels to [~evaluate.EvaluationModule.compute] to calculate the accuracy:

import numpy as np
def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
     predictions = np.argmax(eval_pred.predictions,
