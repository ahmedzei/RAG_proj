io file matches the sampling rate of the audio data a model was pretrained with. You can find this information in the Wav2Vec2 model card.
Set a maximum input length to batch longer inputs without truncating them.

def preprocess_function(examples):
     audio_arrays = [x["array"] for x in examples["audio"]]
     inputs = feature_extractor(
         audio_arrays, sampling_rate=feature_extractor.sampling_rate, max_length=16000, truncation=True
     )
     return inputs
