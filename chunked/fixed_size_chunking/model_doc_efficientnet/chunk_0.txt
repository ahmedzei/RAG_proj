EfficientNet
Overview
The EfficientNet model was proposed in EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks 
by Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le. EfficientNets are a family of image classification models, which achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, yet being an order-of-magnitude smaller and faster than previous models.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better acc
