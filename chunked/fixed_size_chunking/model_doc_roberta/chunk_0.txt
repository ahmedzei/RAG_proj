RoBERTa

Overview
The RoBERTa model was proposed in RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach by Yinhan Liu, Myle Ott, Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer
Levy, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Google's BERT model released in 2018.
It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining objective and training with
much larger mini-batches and learning rates.
