Wav2Vec2
Overview
The Wav2Vec2 model was proposed in wav2vec 2.0: A Framework for Self-Supervised Learning of Speech Representations by Alexei Baevski, Henry Zhou, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Michael Auli.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
We show for the first time that learning powerful representations from speech audio alone followed by fine-tuning on
transcribed speech can outperform the best semi-supervised methods while being conceptually simpler. wav2vec 2.0 masks
the speech input in the latent
