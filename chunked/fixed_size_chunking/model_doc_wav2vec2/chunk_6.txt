Decoding multiple audios
If you are planning to decode multiple batches of audios, you should consider using [~Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM.batch_decode] and passing an instantiated multiprocessing.Pool.
Otherwise, [~Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM.batch_decode] performance will be slower than calling [~Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM.decode] for each audio individually, as it internally instantiates a new Pool for
