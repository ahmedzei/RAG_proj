Usage example
There are 2 main ways to use SigLIP: either using the pipeline API, which abstracts away all the complexity for you, or by using the SiglipModel class yourself.
Pipeline API
The pipeline allows to use the model in a few lines of code:
thon

from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image
import requests
load pipe
image_classifier = pipeline(task="zero-shot-image-classification", model="google/siglip-base-patch16-224")
load image
