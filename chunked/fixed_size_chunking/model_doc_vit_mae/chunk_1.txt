puter vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the
input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates
only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask
tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a n
