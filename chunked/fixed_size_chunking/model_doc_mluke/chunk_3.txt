Usage tips
One can directly plug in the weights of mLUKE into a LUKE model, like so:
thon
from transformers import LukeModel
model = LukeModel.from_pretrained("studio-ousia/mluke-base")

Note that mLUKE has its own tokenizer, [MLukeTokenizer]. You can initialize it as follows:
thon
from transformers import MLukeTokenizer
tokenizer = MLukeTokenizer.from_pretrained("studio-ousia/mluke-base")
