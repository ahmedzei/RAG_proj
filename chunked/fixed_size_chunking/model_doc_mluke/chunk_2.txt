l language model with 24 languages
with entity representations and show the model consistently outperforms word-based pretrained models in various
cross-lingual transfer tasks. We also analyze the model and the key insight is that incorporating entity
representations into the input allows us to extract more language-agnostic features. We also evaluate the model with a
multilingual cloze prompt task with the mLAMA dataset. We show that entity-based prompt elicits correct factual
knowledge more likely than us
