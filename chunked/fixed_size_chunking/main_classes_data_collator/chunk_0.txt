Data Collator
Data collators are objects that will form a batch by using a list of dataset elements as input. These elements are of
the same type as the elements of train_dataset or eval_dataset.
To be able to build batches, data collators may apply some processing (like padding). Some of them (like
[DataCollatorForLanguageModeling]) also apply some random data augmentation (like random masking)
on the formed batch.
Examples of use can be found in the example scripts or example notebooks.
