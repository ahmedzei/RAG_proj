ssing consists of several steps that convert images into the input expected by the model. These steps
include but are not limited to resizing, normalizing, color channel correction, and converting images to tensors.

Image preprocessing often follows some form of image augmentation. Both image preprocessing and image augmentation
transform image data, but they serve different purposes:

Image augmentation alters images in a way that can help prevent overfitting and increase the robustness of the model. You
