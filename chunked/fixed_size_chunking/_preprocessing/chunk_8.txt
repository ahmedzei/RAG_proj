e model inputs, need to have a uniform shape. Padding is a strategy for ensuring tensors are rectangular by adding a special padding token to shorter sentences.
Set the padding parameter to True to pad the shorter sequences in the batch to match the longest sequence:

batch_sentences = [
     "But what about second breakfast?",
     "Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.",
     "What about elevensies?",
 ]
encoded_input = tokenizer(batch_sentences, padding=True)
print(encoded_input)
