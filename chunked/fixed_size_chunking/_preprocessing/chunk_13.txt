Build tensors
Finally, you want the tokenizer to return the actual tensors that get fed to the model.
Set the return_tensors parameter to either pt for PyTorch, or tf for TensorFlow:

batch_sentences = [
     "But what about second breakfast?",
     "Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.",
     "What about elevensies?",
 ]
encoded_input = tokenizer(batch_sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
print(encoded_input)
{'input_ids': tensor([[101, 1252, 1184, 1164, 1248, 64
