     return inputs

Apply the preprocess_function to the first few examples in the dataset:

processed_dataset = preprocess_function(dataset[:5])

The sample lengths are now the same and match the specified maximum length. You can pass your processed dataset to the model now!

processed_dataset["input_values"][0].shape
(100000,)
processed_dataset["input_values"][1].shape
(100000,)

Computer vision
For computer vision tasks, you'll need an image processor to prepare your dataset for the model.
