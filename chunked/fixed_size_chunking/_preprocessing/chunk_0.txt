Before you can train a model on a dataset, it needs to be preprocessed into the expected model input format. Whether your data is text, images, or audio, they need to be converted and assembled into batches of tensors. ðŸ¤— Transformers provides a set of preprocessing classes to help prepare your data for the model. In this tutorial, you'll learn that for:

Text, use a Tokenizer to convert text into a sequence of tokens, create a numerical representation of the tokens, and assembl
