ociated with the model.

Load the food101 dataset (see the ğŸ¤— Datasets tutorial for more details on how to load a dataset) to see how you can use an image processor with computer vision datasets:

Use ğŸ¤— Datasets split parameter to only load a small sample from the training split since the dataset is quite large!

from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("food101", split="train[:100]")

Next, take a look at the image with ğŸ¤— Datasets Image feature:

dataset[0]["image"]
