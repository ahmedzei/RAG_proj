 the few models that has no sequence length limit.
Same as a regular GPT model, but introduces a recurrence mechanism for two consecutive segments (similar to a regular RNNs with two consecutive inputs). In this context, a segment is a number of consecutive tokens (for instance 512) that may span across multiple documents, and segments are fed in order to the model.
Basically, the hidden states of the previous segment are concatenated to the current input to compute the attention scores. This allows the mod
