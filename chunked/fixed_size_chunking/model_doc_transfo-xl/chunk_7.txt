el to pay attention to information that was in the previous segment as well as the current one. By stacking multiple attention layers, the receptive field can be increased to multiple previous segments.
This changes the positional embeddings to positional relative embeddings (as the regular positional embeddings would give the same results in the current input and the current hidden state at a given position) and needs to make some adjustments in the way attention scores are computed.
