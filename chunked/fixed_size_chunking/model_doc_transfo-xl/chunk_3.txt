The abstract from the paper is the following:
Transformers have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a fixed-length context in the
setting of language modeling. We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency
beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a
novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables c
