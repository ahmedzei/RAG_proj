This model is in maintenance mode only, so we won't accept any new PRs changing its code. This model was deprecated due to security issues linked to pickle.load.
We recommend switching to more recent models for improved security.
In case you would still like to use TransfoXL in your experiments, we recommend using the Hub checkpoint with a specific revision to ensure you are downloading safe files from the Hub.
